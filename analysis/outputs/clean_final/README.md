## üöÄ Next Steps

To work with this data:

1. **View Tasks by Procedure**:
   ```python
   import pandas as pd
   tasks = pd.read_csv('patient_care_tasks_final.csv')
   tasks[tasks['specific_procedure'].str.contains('Knee')]
   ```

2. **Get Procedure-Specific Instructions**:
   ```python
   overviews = pd.read_csv('procedure_overviews_final_with_names.csv')
   overviews[overviews['procedure_name'] == 'Total Hip Replacement']
   ```

3. **Analyze Task Categories**:
   ```python
   import json
   with open('category_frequency_final.json') as f:
       freq = json.load(f)
   ```
