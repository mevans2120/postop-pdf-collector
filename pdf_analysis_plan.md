# Post-Operative PDF Care Task Analysis Plan

## 🎯 Project Overview
Analyze all collected post-operative PDFs to extract and categorize care tasks, metadata, and procedure information into a structured CSV format for comprehensive analysis.

## 📊 Analysis Objectives

### Primary Goals
1. **Extract Care Tasks**: Identify all specific post-operative care instructions
2. **Categorize Task Types**: Group tasks by type (medication, activity, wound care, etc.)
3. **Capture Metadata**: Document timing, frequency, duration for each task
4. **Procedure Overview**: Extract common introduction/overview patterns
5. **Create Reference System**: Link all data back to source PDFs

### Secondary Goals
- Identify common patterns across procedures
- Find procedure-specific unique requirements
- Document warning signs and complications
- Track follow-up appointment schedules

## 📋 Data Structure & CSV Schema

### Primary CSV: `postop_care_analysis.csv`
```
pdf_filename, pdf_path, procedure_category, specific_procedure, confidence_score, 
task_id, task_category, task_subcategory, task_description, timing, frequency, duration, 
importance_level, prerequisites, contraindications, warning_signs,
special_equipment, provider_contact, follow_up_required, notes, is_new_category
```

### Supporting CSV: `procedure_overviews.csv`
```
pdf_filename, procedure_category, specific_procedure,
procedure_description, typical_duration, anesthesia_type,
hospital_stay, recovery_timeline, success_rate, risks_mentioned
```

### Category Discovery CSV: `discovered_categories.csv`
```
category_name, subcategory_name, first_found_in_pdf, frequency_count,
example_tasks, common_procedures, suggested_parent_category, confidence
```

### Initial Task Categories (Will Expand During Analysis)
- **Wound Care**: Dressing changes, incision care, drainage management
- **Medication Management**: Pain meds, antibiotics, anticoagulants
- **Activity Restrictions**: Weight bearing, lifting limits, driving
- **Physical Therapy**: Exercises, ROM activities, strengthening
- **Diet & Nutrition**: Dietary restrictions, hydration, supplements
- **Hygiene**: Bathing, showering restrictions
- **Monitoring**: Vital signs, symptom tracking
- **Follow-up Care**: Appointments, imaging, lab work
- **Emergency Signs**: When to call doctor, ER criteria

### Dynamic Category Discovery Strategy

#### Potential New Categories to Watch For:
- **Equipment/Device Management**: CPAP, braces, compression devices, drains
- **Breathing/Respiratory Care**: Incentive spirometry, coughing exercises
- **Skin/Scar Management**: Scar massage, sun protection, moisturizing
- **Sleep Positioning**: Elevation requirements, side restrictions
- **Cognitive/Mental Health**: Memory exercises, mood monitoring
- **Sexual Activity**: Restrictions and timeline for resumption
- **Travel Restrictions**: Flying, long car rides, altitude changes
- **Work/Occupation Specific**: Return to work timelines by job type
- **Alternative Therapies**: Ice/heat therapy, acupuncture permissions
- **Home Modifications**: Safety equipment, bathroom modifications
- **Insurance/Documentation**: Forms to complete, disability paperwork
- **Nutrition Supplements**: Specific vitamins, protein requirements
- **Communication/Speech**: For throat/neck surgeries
- **Vision/Hearing Care**: Special precautions for sensory procedures
- **Pet Interactions**: Restrictions on pet handling/lifting

#### Discovery Methods:
1. **Pattern Recognition**: Identify recurring uncategorized tasks
2. **AI Clustering**: Use NLP to group similar instructions
3. **Frequency Analysis**: Tasks appearing in >5% of PDFs suggest new category
4. **Procedure-Specific**: Unique requirements for specialized surgeries
5. **Temporal Patterns**: Tasks grouped by recovery phase

   - Pattern matching for common task formats
   - Extract temporal information (when, how often, how long)

3. **Metadata Extractor**
   - Procedure identification
   - Timeline extraction
   - Contact information parsing

4. **AI-Enhanced Analysis**
   - Use Gemini API for complex instruction interpretation
   - Categorize ambiguous tasks
   - Extract implicit warnings and precautions

### Phase 3: Pilot Testing (1 hour)

- [ ] Validate extraction accuracy
- [ ] Refine patterns and rules
- [ ] Adjust AI prompts

### Phase 4: Full Analysis Run (3-4 hours)
- [ ] Process all 278 organized PDFs
- [ ] Implement progress tracking
- [ ] Handle errors gracefully
- [ ] Save intermediate results

### Phase 5: Quality Assurance (1 hour)
- [ ] Validate CSV output
- [ ] Check for missing data
- [ ] Verify task categorization
- [ ] Cross-reference with source PDFs

## 🚀 Execution Steps

### Step 1: Create Analysis Script
```python
# Key functions needed:
- extract_pdf_text(pdf_path)
- parse_care_tasks(text)
- categorize_task(task_text)
- discover_new_categories(uncategorized_tasks)
- suggest_category_taxonomy(task_text)
- extract_timing_info(task_text)
- extract_procedure_overview(text)
- generate_csv_row(task_data)
- update_category_discovery_log(new_category)
```

### Step 2: Pattern Library
Common patterns to detect:
- "Do not [action] for [duration]"
- "Take [medication] every [frequency]"
- "Call your doctor if [symptom]"
- "You may resume [activity] after [time]"
- "[Number] weeks after surgery"
- "For the first [duration]"

### Step 3: AI Prompt Templates
```
For task extraction:
"Extract all post-operative care instructions from this text. 
For each instruction, identify:
1. The specific action required
2. When it should be done
3. How often
4. Any warnings or precautions
5. Suggest a category from the provided list, or propose a NEW category if none fit"

For category discovery:
"Analyze these uncategorized care tasks and suggest:
1. Potential new category names
2. Common themes or patterns
3. Why existing categories don't fit
4. Related tasks that might belong together"

For procedure overview:
"Summarize the surgical procedure described, including:
1. Procedure name and type
2. Typical duration
3. Recovery timeline
4. Key risks mentioned
5. Any unique or unusual care requirements"
```
