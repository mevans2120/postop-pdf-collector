      "text_content": "Post-op Instructions for Total Knee Replacement These instructions are to compliment the information given by the nursing staff and physical therapists. They cover many of the common questions. Wound Care \u2022Dressings are to be kept clean and dry. A small amount of clear drainage or bleeding is normal. If this is happening, the dressing should be changed daily. \u2022You may get the incision wet when showering 3 days after surgery. The shower should be brief and the wound patted dry with a clean towel. No baths or soaking the incision until 2-3 weeks after surgery and scabs are absent. \u2022Staples or stitches are usually removed 2 weeks after surgery. \u2022If purulent drainage (thick white or greenish in color) is coming from the wound, or the wound has increasing redness, or if you are having a temperature of 101 or higher, please report these symptoms to your surgeon or the doctor on call. Ice Therapy \u2022Apply ice to your knee to help decrease pain and swelling. You should use your iceman machine as much as possible. A good rule of thumb is to use it whenever you are at rest. This should continue for the first 3-4 weeks after surgery. Pain and Swelling \u2022 Narcotic pain medication will be prescribed for use after you leave the hospital. Try to wean down as tolerated. These medications can cause constipation and you may want to use an over the counter stool softener. Tylenol products may be used instead of the prescribed pain medication. The prescribed narcotic medications should not be taken at the same time as plain Tylenol. If a refill of medication is needed, please call the office during regular business hours, Monday-Friday 8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. In general, refills will not be made after hours or on weekends, so please plan ahead. \u2022 Swelling to some degree is common after surgery. To reduce swelling, elevation is very helpful. Elevate the knee above the heart level (\u201ctoes above the nose\u201d) for 30 minutes every 2 hours is a good recommendation for the first 2-5 days after surgery. The white stockings are also designed to reduce swelling. Excessive pain and swelling should be reported to your surgeon. Weight Bearing \u2022 Unless the physical therapist or nursing staff has told you otherwise, there are no restrictions for the amount of weight that you can put on your knee. You may require the assistance of a walker or crutches for 2-3 weeks after your surgery. Preventing Blood Clots \u2022 Moving your ankles up and down on a regular basis helps circulate blood from your legs to help prevent a blood clot. \u2022 Coumadin is a blood thinner that almost all patients will take after surgery for a total of four weeks. While on Coumadin you will need to be monitored with a blood test called INR. This will be checked twice a week at a laboratory near you while you are taking Coumadin. You will be contacted if you need to adjust your dose. \u2022 White compressive stockings help prevent swelling and blood from pooling in your legs. You do not need to sleep with them on. You should put them on first thing in the morning. They are recommended for the first three weeks after surgery. Dental Work Antibiotic prophylaxis for dental work will be necessary. This involves an oral dose of oral antibiotics before any dental procedure. Please talk to your dentist or call our office for a prescription before having any dental work. Driving To drive you must no longer be taking narcotic pain pills (plain Tylenol is allowed). Also, you must feel strong and alert. Most people start driving 3-4 weeks after surgery. Follow-up Make sure an appointment has been scheduled for you at Chippewa Valley Orthopedics & Sports Medicine for approximately 10-14 days after surgery.

Thank you for choosing us for your knee replacement surgery. Our premier orthopaedic surgery team will take great care of you. The University of Florida Orthopaedic Surgery program began in 1960 as a division of the College of Medicine Department of Surgery. In 1975, the Division of Orthopaedic Surgery achieved full departmental status. Our UF Health Orthopaedics and Rehabilitation team has earned a reputation for excellence in research, teaching and clinical care. Our commitment to patient health care motivates every aspect of our efforts, from the bedside, to the classroom, to the research lab. Your doctor has explained your procedure and what to expect following surgery. The pur pose of this guide is to provide you with more information about what to expect during recovery, what you can do to prevent any complications and how you can maximize your outcomes. Although the health care team will assist you in your recovery, you and your family are the most important members of the team. We believe knowledge and preparation before and after the operation will make your recovery easier. If you have questions along the way, be sure to ask them. We are here to help you achieve your goals and we want you to be satisfied with your entire experience. Our goal is excellent service, from start to finish. So, let\u2019s begin. 1 YOUR \u201cNEW\u201d KNEE Your doctor has explained how your painful knee will be replaced with an artificial knee joint called a prosthesis. The prosthesis is designed to work in the same way as your natural knee. There are two types of knee arthroplasty: total knee arthroplasty and unicompartmental arthroplasty. You need to ask your orthopaedic surgeon the difference between the two and who qualifies for the different types. Your surgeon will carefully choose the best type of prosthesis for you. Some patients will need a total knee arthroplasty or a partial knee replacement while others may have both knees operated on at the same time. The pictures below show the parts of the prosthetic knee. Arthritic knee Prosthetic knee Your new knee will function like a door hinge. Like the natural knee, the prosthesis will give you smooth, pain-free movement. A prosthesis will be inserted to \u201creplace\u201d your deteriorated joint areas. The prosthesis is custom-fit to you by your surgeon. You will need to do exercises to strengthen your muscles and give your knee time to heal. In addition, you will be taught exercises that make all of the muscles surrounding your knee stronger and will increase the movement of your knee. You should not attempt to kneel for at least six weeks following surgery. The amount of discomfort will be your guide for how much kneeling you can do after that time. Your prosthetic knee is meant to be moved. Please walk and do your exercises often. At least two times a day for exercises and 3 walks of a distance of at least 30 feet each. Progress distance a minimum by 10 feet each day or whatever you can tolerate. 2 2 ANSWERS TO SOME FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS ABOUT TOTAL KNEE SURGERY Are there any major risks? Most surgeries go well with no complications. There are two serious complications that are most concerning \u2013 infection and blood clots. To avoid these, antibiotics are used during and after surgery as well as blood thinners. Special precautions are taken in the operating room to reduce the risk of infection. Why do I need a care coach? A care coach is the person that has agreed to stay with you for at least 1 week , day and night after surgery. This person will be helping you with light house duties, providing stand by assistance for mobility, especially when you walk to and from the bathroom and helping with pets and meals. Most patients go home after surgery, and you can decide whether in home therapy or outpatient therapy is the best choice for you . In rare instances, patients may need a rehab placement if mobility level, care coach availability, or home setting is not ideal for discharge directly home. It is important to know what your insurance company will pay for in regards to therapy coverage after surgery. Will I need equipment before I go home? YES. You will be using a basic 2 wheeled walker when you go home. The physical therapist, physician and case manager will help you decide which is safest and how long to use each device. A three-in-one bedside commode will likely be needed. Equipment that is recommended for your home may be covered by insurance. The case manager will secure these items for you before discharge. Additional items, such as a tub bench and grab bars in the tub or shower, may be helpful. However, insurance companies will not pay for them or the installation. These items would be best purchased and installed be",

      "text_content": "Orthopaedic Surgery Joint Preservation and Replacement Center After Total Knee Replacement Postoperative Instructions Congratulations! You are going home after a successful total knee replacement. Although there is still much work to do, we have already achieved a lot. So, when you get home, take a deep breath and relax. The benefits of a total knee replacement are great, but they do take a while to be realized. We have put together some helpful hints, instructions, and information that will make your transition to home easier. Getting Good Range of Motion After Knee Replacement Most of your improvement after a knee replacement will take time. However, the one thing that you must feel some urgency to accomplish is getting good range of motion of your knee (flexibility). Within 7 to 10 days after your knee replacement, you should be able to get your knee entirely straight/full extension (Fig. 1) (no space between the back of your knee and the table) and you should be able to bend/flex your knee to at least 90 degrees (Fig. 2). 90 degrees is the same thing as a right angle. If you achieve 90 degrees by one week, and continue to push forward after this, you will end up with excellent range of motion of your knee replacement. Most of our patients end up with 120 to 125 degrees of flexion. Fig. 1 Fig. 2 Make sure that you know how much flexibility you have in your knee. Make sure you ask your therapist specifically how much bend your knee has at each visit. This will help you know if you are progressing appropriately. We will call you at home after surgery and we will expect you to know the range-of-motion of your knee in degrees (extension AND flexion). This will enable us to tell you if you have made the appropriate progress to have a successful outcome of your surgery. Here are some tips that will help you accomplish full flexibility of your knee(s) in the appropriate time frame: \u2022 Use commercial breaks (if you\u2019re a TV watcher) or the end of a chapter (if you\u2019re a book reader) to help gain the bend in your knee. Sit in a chair that will allow you to slide forward while keeping your feet firmly planted on the floor. Bend your knee as far as you can on your own. Then with your feet firmly planted in place, slide forward on your chair, which will force your knee into a more bent Robert Arciero, M.D. Tessa Balach, M.D. 860.679.6645 860.679.2105 Thomas DeBerardino, M.D. Vincent Williams, M.D. 860.679.6692 860.679.8384 UConn Musculoskeletal Institute Avon Medical Office Southington Medical Office 263 Farmington Avenue 2 Simsbury Road 1115 West Street Farmington, CT 06030 Avon, CT 06001 Southington, CT 06489 860.679.6600 uconnmsi.uchc.edu Rev. 09/15 Orthopaedic Surgery Joint Preservation and Replacement Center After Total Knee Replacement Post Op Instructions. position. Hold this position during the commercial time or for two minutes if you\u2019re a book reader. Then relax until next commercial or chapter break. Make sure your chair is against a wall while doing these exercises. \u2022 In the same manner, you can use a coffee table or a footrest to help gain the ability to straighten your knee fully. At each commercial or chapter break, rest your heel on the coffee table or footrest allowing gravity to pull the knee out straight. You may also push down on your knee for additional pressure in the downward direction. Hold this until the commercial is over or for two minutes. Another option is to roll up a bath towel, or use a 2-liter bottle, and place it under your ankle. Since most of us sleep with our knees bent it is important that you work on straightening the knee out as soon as you wake up in the morning. During the first month after surgery do not place anything under your knee while you sleep or rest. Although many of you will have a therapist monitoring your progress at home, it is your responsibility to obtain good range of motion. The therapist and your family can encourage you, but you must do it. If you want to optimize the outcome of your knee replacement you must work hard to obtain the appropriate motion and full extension. Remember that there is no true mechanical barrier to your knee bending to 90 degrees within one week. The reason that it is difficult to bend is due to the pain. Work hard on controlling your swelling, ice the knee frequently, take your pain medications, and bend the knee. We want you to do your exercises 2 to 3 times a day, every day, for the first 2 to 3 months after your knee replacement. Although a therapist may be seeing you 2 or 3 times per week, this means that you are in charge of the majority of your Robert Arciero, M.D. Tessa Balach, M.D. 860.679.6645 860.679.2105 Thomas DeBerardino, M.D. Vincent Williams, M.D. 860.679.6692 860.679.8384 UConn Musculoskeletal Institute Avon Medical Office Southington Medical Office 263 Farmington Avenue 2 Simsbury Road 1115 West Street Farmington, CT 06030 Avon, CT 06001 Southington, CT 06489 860.679.6600 uconnmsi.uchc.edu Rev. 09/15 Orthopaedic Sur",

      "text_content": "General Post-Operative Instructions Total Knee Replacement Ryan W. Hess, MD Tracey Pederson, PCC Office: (763) 302-2223 Fax: (763) 302-2401 WOUND CARE: \u2022 After surgery, wounds are typically covered with an adhesive dressing. This should be left in place for 2 weeks. Dressings will be removed at your first post-op appointment. \u2022 Skin stitches or staples will be removed in clinic. In some cases, there may not be anything to remove (stitches are under the skin). \u2022 You may shower once the initial dressing is removed (at the first clinic visit) with a watertight dressing in place. Do not submerge the wounds in water (bathtub, pool, lake) until 6 weeks after surgery. Continue to cover the wound in the shower for the first 6 weeks after surgery. \u2022 If the dressings become saturated or drainage continues beyond the first few days, call the office. ICING: \u2022 Icing is an important part of recovery from surgery. It is used to decrease swelling and inflammation. \u2022 An ice machine is often offered to patients to use hours after surgery. If you have chosen to purchase this machine, it should be used continuously for approximately 48 hours after surgery. \u2022 If you did not purchase the ice machine, you can substitute a bag of ice or frozen vegetables. \u2022 After the first 48 hours, the unit should be used in 20 minute intervals every couple of hours for the first 3-4 weeks after surgery. \u2022 Keeping your leg elevated above your heart will also help decrease swelling. DIET: \u2022 After surgery, some patients experience nausea. This can be related to anesthesia or pain medication. It is best to begin with clear liquids and light food (crackers). You may progress slowly to your normal diet if not nauseated. \u2022 Patients are often prescribed an anti-nausea medication after surgery. This can be used to treat nausea. If nausea or vomiting persists despite medication, call the office. \u2022 Pain medication can also cause constipation. An over-the-counter laxative, high-fiber diet or fruit juice may be helpful. MEDICATION: \u2022 Most home medications may be resumed after surgery unless specifically directed by your surgeon. \u2022 Typically, patients are given a prescription for pain medication. Please take this medication as instructed to control your pain. The goal is to decrease use of the medication as pain improves after surgery. \u2022 Try to take pain medication with food to help decrease nausea. \u2022 Some prescribed pain medication may already have Tylenol (Acetaminophen) mixed with it. Do not take any other medications that include Tylenol while taking these pain medications. Taking too much Tylenol can cause liver damage. \u2022 Taking medication prior to bedtime may help with sleeping. \u2022 Do not drink alcohol or drive while taking narcotic pain medication (hydrocodone, oxycodone, dilaudid, etc.). \u2022 Pain medication typically takes about 30-45 minutes to take effect. Don\u2019t wait until pain is severe to take pain medication. \u2022 Some patients may receive a nerve block prior to surgery. This block lasts a different length of time in each patient, but typically lasts 12-18 hours. When you begin to feel some tingling in the extremity, the block is beginning to wear off. This is a good time to begin taking oral pain medication. \u2022 Pain medication likely will not take away all of your pain. It is okay to have some discomfort. \u2022 Because of the risks of prolonged narcotic use, in most cases narcotic pain medication will not be prescribed after 6 weeks from surgery. Plan to wean narcotic use accordingly. ACTIVITY: \u2022 Crutches or a walker will be used initially after surgery for protection. These are typically needed for 1-3 weeks depending on the patient. Your physical therapist will help you decide when it is okay to stop using the crutches or walker. \u2022 You may bear full weight on the operated leg immediately after surgery. \u2022 Return to work depends on your job requirements, specifics of your surgery and pain/swelling levels. This can be discussed at your follow-up appointment. \u2022 Do not resume sports, use exercise equipment or perform strenuous physical activity (including lifting weights) until your surgeon says it is okay. \u2022 Physical therapy will be prescribed after surgery. This is an important part of your recovery and we encourage patients to attend all physical therapy appointments. \u2022 Return to driving after surgery is okay once narcotic pain medication has been stopped and you are cleared by your surgeon. The length of time until patients are able to return to driving varies depending which leg is involved. BLOOD CLOT PREVENTION: \u2022 Though uncommon, blood clots (also called deep vein thrombosis or DVT) can occur after surgery. To decrease the risk of this problem, you should flex your ankle and toes up and down ten times per hour for the first 2-3 weeks after surgery. \u2022 Elevation of the operative leg also helps decrease swelling and prevent blood clots. \u2022 Medication will be given after surgery to prevent blood clots. The specific medication may vary depending on your med",

What is a Total Knee Replacement? During total knee replacement, the surgeon removes damaged cartilage from your knee. Then the surgeon replaces it with prosthetic implants made of metal (cobalt chromium or oxinium, and titanium) and plastic. The implant is then either fit to your bone or put in place with a special type of cement. Surgery may be performed with special technology such as computer navigation or robotic assistance. You can expect your new knee to last for many years. In fact, 95% of total knee replacements last more than 10 years. Most knee replacements continue to function well even 20 years after A.D.A.M. Images surgery. Innovations in knee replacement design and materials may allow modern implants to last even longer. How long your knee replacement will last depends on different factors: your age, weight, and activity level. Thank you for allowing me to partner with you to improve your bone and joint health. 4 Medication",

      "text_content": "Total Knee Arthroplasty (TKA) Rehabilitation Protocol Anatomy and Biomechanics The knee is a simple hinge joint at the connection point between the femur and tibia bones. The smooth articular cartilage surface of the femur sits on top of the cushioning discs of fibrocartilage on the tibia known as the medial and lateral meniscus. These smooth surfaces that make up the knee joint will naturally wear down over time creating a rougher surface with which to weight bear on. Without smooth healthy cartilage the knee also has a hard time producing the natural joint fluid that lubricates the knee during movement. Collectively, these degenerative processes that happen over time lead to the condition known as osteoarthritis. This process happens naturally over time to everyone, but can be more severe or develop quicker in some people. As degenerative changes in the knee advance the joint becomes more painful and less mobile. Osteoarthritis typically results in stiffness in the joint and pain during weight bearing activity. This is especially true right after a period of immobility (ie when getting up after sitting for a long time). The pain in the joint may subside after moving around, but become worse again when standing or walking for long periods of time. As the condition of the joint deteriorates it will become more difficult to bear weight on it and eventually the joint may lose some of its range of motion. Treatment Options Based on the nature and severity of the osteoarthritis in your knee your physician will work with you to determine what the best course of treatment will be. When degenerative changes are not severe the associated pain and dysfunction may successfully be treated with rest, anti-inflammatory measures, activity modification and physical therapy. Injections of cortisone or joint lubricants may provide temporary improvement in pain and function. After a thorough evaluation your physician and their staff will recommend the most appropriate course of action to take. Physical therapy is often recommended for treatment of pain and dysfunction associated with osteoarthritis. The physical therapist will evaluate your mobility, flexibility and strength with the purpose of determining any underlying deficits that contribute to increased stress on the painful joint. You will be counseled on which activities you can safely continue and which should be avoided. The physical therapist will teach you exercises that will help to reduce joint stress. In most cases this will include strengthening and stretching the muscles around the hip and knee, as well as strengthening your core. If joint degeneration is severe and conservative measures are unsuccessful in restoring function your physician may recommend a total knee replacement procedure. Surgery Total Knee Arthroplasty (Replacement) is a complex procedure that involves the removal and SouthShoreHealth.org replacement of both the tibial and femoral weight bearing surfaces of the knee. First the ends of both bones are removed. Then metal implants are inserted into the ends of the femur and tibia. The metal implant that is used on the tibial side of the joint has a polyethylene (plastic) piece attached to it that serves as the weight bearing surface of the new joint. Your surgeon may elect to use bone cement to help hold these implants in place. During the knee replacement procedure the undersurface of the knee cap is often removed as well, and is replaced with a polyethylene cap. Some of the structural ligaments of the knee may also be adjusted during the procedure so as to assure that the knee is stable and well aligned after surgery. Each patient will be required to go through a pre-operative educational class which will review in detail the typical patient experience in the early phases of recovery. Some physicians require an appointment with your dentist to ensure there are no active dental problems. Issues such as dental infection may affect the results of your surgery. Many patients will also be required to see their primary care physician prior to surgery. Total Knee Arthroplasty is not currently an outpatient day surgery procedure. You will typically spend 1-2 days in the hospital to recover. You will be out of bed the same day as your surgery. You will be working with physical and occupational therapy on a daily basis in the hospital. Most patients are able to go directly home after discharge. Some more complex cases may require a short stay in a rehab facility following their hospital stay. Home Visits You will likely receive home care visits from a registered nurse and a physical therapist after being discharged home. The nurse will help monitor your medical status and the physical therapist will help you work to restore mobility, strength and tolerance for activity. Your home care physical therapist will work with your surgeon and their staff to determine when you are ready to attend outpatient physical therapy. This will typically be around 3 wee",

      "text_content": "Home Therapy Exercises After Total Knee Replacement Recovery after Surgery To see the full benefit of knee replacement, therapy will be a necessary part of the rehabilitation process. Therapy can reduce swelling, decrease pain, improve range-of-motion, build strength, challenge balance and develop endurance. Most patients are able to return to sedentary jobs and activities such as driving within four to six weeks while more demanding occupations may take longer It is recommended you dedicate 30-60 minutes each day for exercises. You can break up your exercise routine and do some exercises in the morning and others in the afternoon or perform different groups of exercises on different days. The American Association of Hip and Knee Surgeons (AAHKS) has outlined a home exercise program for you after your knee replacement. This guide accompanies our patient exercise videos that you can watch at www.AAHKS.org/HipKnee. Exercises will focus on stretching, strengthening, endurance and balance. The knee rehabilitation program is broken down into three phases: Weeks 1-3, Weeks 4-6, Weeks 7-12. This program starts with a warm-up period of stretching followed by more specific exercises for the knee muscles. We recommend using over-the-counter anti-inflammatory medications such as ibuprofen, naproxen, meloxicam or a pain reliever such as acetaminophen before or after exercising to help with swelling and discomfort. Please follow your physician\u2019s guidance and the dosing directions on the package. We recommend brief warm-up and cool-down periods before and after exercising. These exercises are a general guide to rehabilitation after total joint replacement. After completing the 12- week program, you should continue a \u201cmaintenance exercise program\u201d two to three days a week to keep your muscles strong and to maintain a healthy lifestyle. Frequent follow up appointments will be required to check your progress.

Stretching helps to prevent injury by getting the muscles ready for a workout. Typically, patients are advised to spend 5-10 minutes stretching before exercising. A heating pad or warm towel can be used to help relax the muscles in preparation for stretching. The following stretches can also be performed in between exercises to keep the muscles from getting tight. A progressive stretching routine can also help to break up scar tissue that will form after your knee replacement. It is recommended that your exercise program begin and finish with stretches. Ice can be applied to the knee or sore muscles after exercising.

      "text_content": "Total Hip Arthroplasty (THA) Rehabilitation Protocol Anatomy and Biomechanics The hip is a ball and socket joint located where the thigh meets the pelvis. The upper end of the thigh bone (head of the femur) is formed in the shape of a ball, which sits in the socket of the pelvic bone called the acetabulum. The hip joint is a very stable joint due to the natural deep fit of the head of the femur in the acetabulum. It is also surrounded and supported by strong ligaments and muscles. Both the head of the femur and the acetabulum are covered with smooth cartilage, which allow the bones to easily glide on each other. This cartilage will naturally wear down over time creating a rougher surface with which to weight bear on. Without smooth healthy cartilage the hip also has a hard time producing the natural joint oil (synovial fluid) that lubricates the hip during movement. Collectively, these degenerative processes that happen over time lead to the condition known as osteoarthritis. This process happens naturally overtime, but can be more severe http://web.ebscohost.com/rrc/detail?sid= 1 or develop quicker in some people. As degenerative changes in the hip advance, the joint becomes more and more painful and less and less mobile. Osteoarthritis typically produces stiffness in the joint and pain during weight bearing activity, especially right after a period of immobility (i.e. first thing in the morning). The pain in the joint may subside after moving around, but become worse again when standing or walking for long periods of time. As the condition of the joint deteriorates it will become harder and harder to bear weight on it and eventually the joint may lose some of its range of motion. http://www.sonoranhipcenter.com/hip-arth 1 Treatment Options Regardless of the nature and severity of the osteoarthritis in your hip your physician will work with you to determine what the best course of treatment will be. When degenerative changes are not severe the associated pain and dysfunction may successfully be treated with rest, anti-inflammatory measures, activity modification and physical therapy. After a thorough evaluation your physician and their staff will recommend the most appropriate course of action to take. Physical therapy is often recommended for treatment of pain and dysfunction associated with osteoarthritis. The physical therapist will evaluate your mobility, flexibility and strength with the purpose of determining any underlying deficits that contribute to increased stress on the painful joint. You will be counseled on which activities you can safely continue and which should be avoided. The physical therapist will teach you exercises that will help to reduce joint stress. In most cases this will include strengthening and stretching the muscles around the hip and knee, as well as strengthening your core. When joint degeneration is severe and conservative measures are unsuccessful in restoring function your physician may recommend a total hip replacement procedure. SouthShoreHealth.org Surgery Total Hip Arthroplasty (Replacement) is a complex procedure that involves the removal and replacement of both the head of the femur and the acetabulum. First, an incision is made, most commonly, along the back or side of the hip. Next, the hip joint is exposed and the head and neck of the femur are removed. Then the acetabulum is cleaned out and replaced with a metal shell and polyethylene (plastic) liner, and the femoral stem is fit into position. Your surgeon may or may not use cement to secure the stem. Lastly, a carefully fitted ceramic \u201cball\u201d is secured onto the stem and the hip is rejoined. Each patient will be required to go through a pre-operative educational class, which will review in detail the typical patient experience in the early phases of recovery. Some physicians require an appointment with your dentist to ensure there are no active dental problems. Issues such as dental infection may affect the results of your surgery. Many patients will also be required to see their primary care physician prior to surgery. After surgery you will spend 1-2 days in the http://web.ebscohost.com/rrc/detail?sid= 2 hospital. You will be out of bed the same day as your surgery. You will be working with physical and occupational therapy on a daily basis in the hospital. Most patients are discharged directly home and will have VNA services come to their house. Some more complex cases may require a short stay in a rehab facility following hospital stay. Dislocation Precautions The new prosthetic joint is not as stable as a natural hip joint. As a result, there are specific precautions you must follow after surgery which vary according to the type of incision used during your surgery: \uf0b7 Posterior Approach\uf0e0 do NOT bend your hip more than 90 degrees, do NOT rotate your hip inward, do NOT bring your leg in across your body beyond neutral (i.e. do not cross your legs), NO combinations of these motions. \uf0b7 Anterolateral Approach\uf0e0 d",

What is a Total Hip Replacement? Total hip replacement is a well-established surgery with a track record of over 5 decades. The hip joint is composed of the femoral head (ball) and the acetabulum (socket). The damaged bone (by arthritis or another condition) is removed and replaced with implants. The implants are made of metal, plastic, and ceramic. They are secured in place with or without bone cement. This surgery can be very beneficial when your hip joint is damaged. Hip replacement relieves pain from arthritis. After complete recovery, most patients walk without a limp. Hip replacement can help you return to an active lifestyle. However, high impact sporting activities such as running may not be safe after hip replacement. If there are specific activities you are concerned about, please discuss them with your surgeon before surgery. You can expect your new hip to last for many years. In fact, 95% of total hip replacements last mo",

      "text_content": "Discharge Instructions for Total Hip Replacement Surgery You have undergone hip replacement surgery. This means your natural hip was replaced with an artificial joint (prosthesis). You may be recovering at home or in a rehabilitation facility. Either way, you must take care of your new hip. Do this by moving and sitting the way you were taught in the hospital. Also, be sure to see your doctor for follow-up visits, and return to activity slowly. Because a total hip replacement is major surgery, it will be a few months before you can move comfortably. Home care \uf0b7 To relieve discomfort at night, get up and move around with your walker. \uf0b7 You are allowed to shower, but no baths until your incision has healed. Your dressing is water-proof and will protect your incision. Sit on a shower stool or chair when you shower to keep from falling. \uf0b7 Take you blood thinner medication as instructed. Incision Care \uf0b7 Check the skin surrounding your incision daily for redness, swelling, tenderness or drainage. \uf0b7 Avoid infection by washing your hands often. If an infection occurs, it will need to be treated immediately. So call your doctor right away if you think you may have an infection. \uf0b7 Avoid soaking your incision in water (no hot tubs, bath tubs, or swimming pools) until your doctor says it's okay. Sitting and Sleeping \uf0b7 Sit in chairs with arms, and sit with your knees slightly lower than your hips. \uf0b7 Don't sit for more than 30 - 45 minutes at one time. \uf0b7 Don't sit on low or sagging chairs or couches \uf0b7 Don't lean forward while sitting \uf0b7 Don't cross your legs \uf0b7 Keep your feet flat on the floor. Don't turn your foot or leg inward. This stresses your hip joint. \uf0b7 Use an elevated toilet seat for 6 weeks after surgery \uf0b7 Ask your healthcare provider if it's okay to sleep on your stomach or on the side that has the new hip. Use pillows between your legs when sleeping on your back or on your side. \uf0b7 Sit on a firm cushion when you ride in the car and avoid sitting too low. Try not to bend your hip too much when getting in and out of the care Revised from Krames online: http:kramesonline.com Moving Safely \uf0b7 The key to successful recovery is movement by walking and exercising your hip as directed by your doctor and physical therapist. \uf0b7 Don't bend at the hip when you bend over. Don't bend at the waist to put on socks and shoes. And avoid picking up items from the floor. \uf0b7 Use a cane, crutches, a walker, or handrails until your balance, flexibility, and strength improve. And remember to ask for help from others when you need it. \uf0b7 Follow your doctor's orders regarding how much weight to put on the affected leg. \uf0b7 Don't drive until your doctor says it's okay. Most people can start driving about 6 weeks after surgery. Don't drive while you are taking narcotic pain medication. Follow Up \uf0b7 A follow up appointment will be made for you 10 - 14 days after your surgery. Other Precautions \uf0b7 Tell all your healthcare providers - including your dentist - about your artificial joint before any procedure. You will likely need to take antibiotics before dental work and other medical procedures to reduce the risk of infection. \uf0b7 Arrange your household to keep items you need handy. Keep everything else out of the way. Remove items that may cause you to fall, such as throw rugs, and electrical cords. \uf0b7 Use non-slip bath mats, grab bars, an elevated toilet seat, and a shower chair in your bathroom. \uf0b7 Keep your hands free by using a backpack, fanny pack, apron or pockets to carry things. \uf0b7 Prevent infection. Ask your doctor for instructions if you haven't already received them. Any infection will need to be treated immediately with antibiotics. Signs of infection are listed below. \uf0b7 Maintain a healthy weight. Get help to lose any extra pounds. Added body weight puts stress on the hip. \uf0b7 Take any medications you have been given after surgery. This may include blood thinning medications to prevent blood clots or antibiotics to prevent infection. Be sure to take ALL your antibiotics. Pain Management \uf0b7 In the hospital you were getting pain pills about every 2 hours. Now that you are going home it is time to start thinking about getting off of the pain pills. \uf0b7 We cannot take away your pain; we do want to manage it so you can continue your daily activities of living and physical therapy. \uf0b7 Start increasing the time between your pain pills. For example: if you were getting pain pills every 2 hours, then start taking pain pills every 3 hours, then every 4 hours etc... \uf0b7 By 2 weeks after your surgery you should only be using prescribed pain pills prior to physical therapy and at night before you go to bed. \uf0b7 You should not be using prescribed pain pills by 6 weeks after your surgery. \uf0b7 Once you have stopped taking your blood thinners, Rivaroxaban, Lovenox, Arixtra or Aspirin, it is safe to start taking Ibuprofen. You can take ibuprofen during the day and use your prescribed pain pills at night and during therapy. Revised from Krames online: http:kramesonline.co",

      "text_content": "Orthopaedic Surgery Joint Preservation and Replacement Center After Total Hip Replacement Postoperative Instructions. Congratulations on your new hip! You are going home after a successful total hip replacement. Although there is still much work to do, we have already achieved a lot. So, when you get home, take a deep breath and relax. The benefits of a total hip replacement are great, but they do take a while to be realized. Hip Precautions For the first three months after your hip replacement, it is important that you follow your hip range of motion precautions. Doing so makes it extremely unlikely that your hip will dislocate (come out of the socket). Your hip replacement is very stable, so you do not need to be paranoid about these precautions but you do need to be aware of your precautions and follow them for the first three months after your surgery. There are two simple rules that you are to follow: 1. Whenever you are sitting and whenever you get in or out of a seated position (i.e., flex of bend at the hip or waist), keep your knees separated a shoulder width or more. For example, whenever you are sitting in a chair, bed, commode, or car keep your knees separated. When you get in or out of these seated positions, it is important to keep your knees separated. 2. If you are already sitting down, do not lean forward to pick anything up off the floor. Use your \u201creacher/grabber\u201d to pick things up from the floor or leave them there until someone else can pick the object up for you; if you must pick something up from the floor use the \u201cgolfer\u2019s stance\u201d (shown below) to do so. Do not try to put your shoes on in a conventional manner. Golfer\u2019s Stance: Resting your opposite hand on a stable My Doctor object for balance, bend at the told me waist and kick your operated not to do leg out behind you, and using this your free hand to reach for the item (see picture on right). Robert Arciero, M.D. Tessa Balach, M.D. 860.679.6645 860.679.2105 Thomas DeBerardino, M.D. Vincent Williams, M.D. 860.679.6692 860.679.8384 UConn Musculoskeletal Institute Avon Medical Office Southington Medical Office 263 Farmington Avenue 2 Simsbury Road 1115 West Street Farmington, CT 06030 Avon, CT 06001 Southington, CT 06489 860.679.6600 uconnmsi.uchc.edu Rev. 09/15 Orthopaedic Surgery Joint Preservation and Replacement Center After Total Hip Replacement Post Op Instructions. If you follow these very simple rules, the likelihood that you will dislocate your hip is very, very low (<1%). At the end of three months, you no longer need to follow these precautions. After three months, you may cross your legs when sitting or lying down. When you are lying in bed your hip is in a very safe position, but it is helpful to sleep with a pillow between your legs for the first 6 weeks after surgery. When you are walking, your hip is also in a very safe position and you do not need to worry about any range of motion precautions. Here are some additional things that we want you to know about your hip and what to expect over the next several days to months: Wound Care Do not place any ointments, lotions, or creams on your wound. We prefer that you leave your wound open to the air, as long as there is no significant drainage from the incision. If there is a small amount of drainage, keep a light dressing over the area that is leaking and tape with paper tape. When it stops draining, you may leave the wound open to the air. If the drainage continues longer than 7 days, please call the office. A change in your rehab protocol may be necessary. You may begin to shower 7 days after your surgery as long as the drainage has stopped. Your staples/sutures will still be in place at that time. Allow soapy water to run over the incision, but do not scrub the incision. Pat the incision dry with a towel after your shower. Please avoid submerging your incision in a bath, pool or hot tub for a minimum of 4 weeks after surgery! If your incision has not completely healed by 4 weeks (i.e., there is still a scab on any part of your incision) please wait to begin any of these activities until it has completely healed. Arrangements will be made for your staples to be removed about 10 to 14 days after your surgery. This may be done at your first post-op office visit or by a home health nurse. Swelling Swelling of the hip and leg after a hip replacement is normal. There are some things that you can do, however, to minimize this problem. Ice the hip frequently for the first two to three weeks after surgery. It is particularly helpful to ice after you have done your exercises or been on your feet for a while. Swelling of the entire leg is also normal. This will slowly improve but may last for as long as several months. To help minimize the swelling, please follow these recommendations: Robert Arciero, M.D. Tessa Balach, M.D. 860.679.6645 860.679.2105 Thomas DeBerardino, M.D. Vincent Williams, M.D. 860.679.6692 860.679.8384 UConn Musculoskeletal Institute Avon Medical Office Sou",

      "text_content": "TOTAL HIP ARTHROPLASTY POST-OP CLINICAL PRACTICE GUIDELINE Total hip arthroplasty (THA), also known as a total hip replacement, is an elective surgical procedure to treat patients who experience pain and dysfunction from an arthritic hip joint. THA is an effective option if the patient\u2019s pain does not respond to conservative treatment and has caused a decline in their health, quality of life, or ability to perform activities of daily living. This procedure removes the arthritic ball and socket structures that make up the hip joint and replaces them with artificial implants. The head of the femur, which makes up the ball of the hip joint, is removed and replaced by a smooth ball with a stem fixed within the femur. The acetabulum, which makes up the socket portion of the hip joint, is fitted with a metal socket with a smooth inner lining. Once in place, the artificial pieces allow improved function of the hip joint. The surgeon will determine the best surgical approach to use for each individual patient. A posterior approach uses an incision curved along the posterior side of the hip behind the greater trochanter. The muscles typically cut during a posterior approach include: TFL, gluteus maximus and hip external rotator muscles. An anterior approach uses an incision that typically starts at the iliac crest and extends down toward the top of the thigh (less commonly, you will find a horizontal incision). The anterior muscles are then divided to display a window to the hip joint and muscles are typically not cut. With a direct lateral approach, it involves a detachment of a portion of the gluteus medius with repair at the end of surgery. Consideration for the partial gluteus medius repair during the lateral approach is important for initial post- operative rehabilitation. For each approach, you will find precautions outlined below that must be strictly followed the first 6 weeks post op to decrease risk of dislocation. After 6 weeks, the patient may gently move into these ranges per tolerance as they increase their return to lifestyle activities. Patients are encouraged to participate in early mobilization while adhering to precautions to improve function and limit post-operative complications. Disclaimer Progression is time and criterion-based, dependent on soft tissue healing, patient demographics, and clinician evaluation.

In addition, you or another person should not force your hip in any direction. Your Occupational Therapist may recommend some equipment to help with your daily activities, such as a reacher, sock aid and/or a raised toilet seat. Walking You are allowed to put as much weight as you feel comfortable with on your operated leg, we call this Weight Bearing As Tolerated. Your physiotherapist will let you know what walking aid you should be using (walker, 2 canes, 1 cane or walking poles). Note: When using one cane, the cane should be held in the hand opposite to your surgery leg. When you are at home you may feel you can progress to using less support (e.g. 1 cane instead of 2), make sure that you do not begin to limp. It is better to walk properly with more support. \uf0b7 Building your strength by doing the exercises given to you in this book will help prevent limping \uf0b7 Practice walking in front of a full length mirror, check that: \u25cb standing up as tall and straight as possible \u25cb shoulders do not sway side to side \u25cb the same amount of weight is on each leg i.e. you are standing straight \uf0b7 Walking is a good activity after surgery but it is important to increase the amount you walk slowly to avoid increasing pain and swelling. For example, try to walk for 5 minutes. If your pain does not increase, try walking for 6 minutes the next day. 1 Reduce Pain and Swelling Ice and Heat: \uf0b7 Ice can be applied to your operated leg for 10-15 minutes every hour, as needed. You may find this most helpful after exercise. When resting, lie flat, apply ice where you have pain, elevate your leg above the level of your heart and move your ankles up and down. This can help reduce swelling, pressure and pain \uf0b7 Beginning one week after surgery, you may apply heat for 10-15 minutes before you exercise. Do not apply heat directly over the incision Pain Medication: \uf0b7 Pain medication should be taken as prescribed \uf0b7 It is important that your pain is controlled so that you are able to complete 2-3 exercise sessions each day and gradually progress your walking \uf0b7 If you have pain when doing your exercises, take your pain medication before starting your exercises. The goal is to be 4/10 or lower (low to moderate pain) on the 0-10 pain scale (0= no pain, 10= pain as bad as it can be) \uf0b7 For more information about pain management visit www.sunnybrook.ca/hipkneepain Sleeping: \uf0b7 You may sleep however you are comfortable. If you are lying on your side you may find it comfortable to sleep with pillow(s) between your thighs \uf0b7 Scar sensitivity is normal and may make it uncomfortable to lie on your operated side. To decrease sensitivity, gradually increase the amount of time you spend lying on your operated side 2 Caring for your new hip After surgery there are no limitations in the way you are allowed to move your hip but you should listen to your body and avoid painful movements or positions. For example, if it increases your pain to sit on a low seat, raise the surface up with a cushion or raised toilet seat. In addition, you or another person should not force your hip in any direction. Do I need a hip cushion, raised toilet seat, shower bench, etc.? Although not required, your Occupational Therapist may recommend some equipment to help with your daily activities, such as a seat cushion or a raised toilet seat. Many people find this equipment very helpful until they have improved strength, balance and mobility",

      "text_content": "Home Therapy Exercises After Total Hip Replacement Recovery after Surgery To see the full benefit of hip replacement, therapy will be a necessary part of the rehabilitation process. Therapy can reduce swelling, decrease pain, improve range-of-motion, build strength, challenge balance, and develop endurance. The majority of patients are able to return to sedentary jobs and activities such as driving within 4-6 weeks while more demanding occupations may take longer. It is recommended you dedicate 30-60 minutes each day for exercises. You can break up your exercise routine and do some exercises in the morning and others in the afternoon or perform different groups of exercises on different days. The American Association of Hip and Knee Surgeons (AAHKS) has outlined a home exercise program for you after your hip replacement. This handout accompanies our patient exercise videos that you can find at www.AAHKS.org/HipKnee. Exercises will focus on stretching, strengthening, endurance, and balance. The hip rehabilitation program is broken down into three phases: Weeks 1-3, Weeks 4-6, Weeks 7 and Beyond. You can print the accompanying schedule to keep track of your progress. This program starts with a warm-up period of stretching followed by more specific exercises for the hip muscles. We recommend using over-the-counter anti-inflammatory medications such as ibuprofen, naproxen, meloxicam or a pain reliever such as acetaminophen before or after exercising to help with swelling and discomfort. Please follow your physician\u2019s guidance and the dosing directions on the package. We recommend brief warm-up and cool-down periods before and after exercising. These exercises are a general guide to rehabilitation after total joint replacement. After completing the eight- week program, you should continue a \u201cmaintenance exercise program\u201d two to three days a week to keep your muscles strong and to keep a healthy lifestyle.

Typically, patients are advised to spend 5-10 minutes stretching before exercising. A heating pad or warm towel can be used to help relax the muscles in preparation for stretching. The following stretches can also be performed in-between exercises to keep the muscles from getting tight. A good stretching routing can also help to break up scar tissue that will form after your hip replacement. It is recommended that your exercise program begin and finish with stretches. Ice can be applied to the hip or sore muscles",

You are encouraged to speak up and take an active role in your care. You and your family are welcome to ask questions and to learn all that you can about your surgery and recovery. Total hip replacement surgery is also called total hip arthroplasty. This means that your hip joint is surgically replaced. For a total hip replacement, you receive anesthesia. During the operation, your surgeon removes the damaged part of your hip. It is replaced with artificial parts, called components or prostheses. Your surgeon chooses the parts that are best for you. Figure 1 shows you what the artificial parts look like and where they are located in the hip. Usually, the operation lasts one to two hours. After the operation, you are taken to a recovery room, also called the post-anesthesia care unit or PACU. Typically you stay in the recovery area for about two hours. How long you stay after your surgery depends on you and your overall health. Some people may go home the same day. Some people may need to stay overnight. And some people may need to stay longer. Talk to your health care provider about your stay. 1 mc2111-01 Risks for Side Effects and Complications Every person and every surgery is different. Although rare, it is possible that your condition may not be helped by surgery. It\u2019s possible that your pain may not lessen or go away completely. Possible side effects Common side effects of surgery include: \u2022 Muscle soreness around the hip joint and leg. \u2022 Swelling and numbness around the hip. \u2022 Headache. \u2022 Nausea, vomiting, headache, dry mouth, sore throat, shivering, and sleepiness are common side effects of anesthesia. The side effects of anesthesia should go away in one to two days. It may take a few weeks to months for muscle soreness, swelling and numbness to go away. Possible complications Common complications of this surgery include the following: \u2022 Replacement part failure. Hip replacement components are very durable. But like any artificial device, these components may become loose or worn over time and require further surgery. \u2022 Changes to the ligaments. Your ligaments are rebalanced at the time of surgery. Rarely, these ligaments can become too loose or too tight after surgery. Ligaments that are too loose can cause instability. Ligaments that are too tight can cause stiffness. \u2022 Nerve damage. Your implant is placed in an area where there are a lot of nerves. Rarely, nerves may be injured when the implant is placed. Nerve damage can cause numbness, weakness and pain. 2 mc2111-01 \u2022 Infection. There is a risk of infection with any surgery. Infections after hip replacement are usually treated with antibiotics but also may require one or more surgeries to cure. \u2022 Blood clot(s). People who have hip replacement surgery are at a greater risk of developing blood clots during the first few weeks after surgery. Your surgical team may take steps to try to avoid a blood clot. Every person\u2019s medical condition is different. Preventive steps and treatment for blood clots are different for each person. \u2022 Complications related to anesthesia. The following possible complications may depend on what type of anesthesia you have. \u2013 Infection at the injection site. \u2013 Bleeding. \u2013 Temporary or permanent nerve injury. \u2013 Serious complications from anesthesia are rare, but they can include stroke and death. 3 mc2111-01 Get Ready for Surgery Recovery after this surgery takes time. Use the following information in the months, weeks and days before your surgery to get yourself and your home ready. Do not use tobacco products for at least two months before surgery Nicotine, carbon monoxide and other poisons in tobacco products decrease your blood flow. Smoking also increases the risk of complications after surgery. Examples include: poor bone and wound healing, pneumonia, blood clots, and the need for more surgery. If you use tobacco products, you must stop using all tobacco products at least two months before your surgery date. You must to agree to stay nicotine-free for at least one year after surgery. It can take up to a year for bones to heal. If you need help to quit, talk to your health care provider. There is help available for you. Tell your health care team about medications you take and devices you have \u2022 Blood-thinning medication. Blood-thinning medications affect clotting and bleeding. Both the health care provider who manages these medications and your surgeon need to decide if your medications need to change. Contact the health care provider who manages these medications about whether you should stop taking them before surgery and for how long. After the procedure, the health care provider who manages these medications and your surgeon need to decide when to restart these medications. \u2022 Pain medications. If y",

      "text_content": "INSTRUCTIONS FOR PATIENTS RECOVERING FROM CATARACT SURGERY 1. Each morning, carefully wipe away any secretions with a moist cotton ball from the corner of the operated eye. DO NOT RUB OR APPLY ANY PRESSURE TO THE EYE. 2. MEDICATIONS: Take all drops exactly as directed 5 MINUTES APART. Do not stop medications unless directed to do so. PLEASE BRING ALL YOUR EYE DROPS, ALONG WITH THIS INSTRUCTION SHEET, EVERY TIME YOU COME TO THE OFFICE. a. Resume taking all medications prescribed by your other doctors. b. Eye drops for use after surgery: You will have received either a single bottle of drops we call our \u201ccombo\u201d drop called (Pred-Moxi- Ketor) OR three separate bottles of prescription drops. These contain an antibiotic, a steroid, and a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory. If you have the \u201cCombo\u201d drop, take it three (3) times a day until the bottle is empty. If you are using the three separate bottles take one drop of each medicine three (3) times a day until the bottles are empty. Continue using the drops, as directed, until the bottles are empty. Please shake the bottle(s) before each use. c. Regular or Extra Strength Tylenol: Take one or two tablets every six hours if needed for discomfort. 3. SPECIAL EYE CARE PRECAUTIONS: a. During the daytime you may wear your glasses, the sunshields, or the eye shield over the operated eye for your protection. WEAR THE EYE SHIELD AT NIGHT FOR ONE WEEK!! NO EXCEPTIONS!!! Baby oil or nail polish remover on a cotton ball can be used to remove the sticky tape residue each morning from the cheek and forehead. b. Resume your normal diet. You can sleep on your back, stomach, or either side. c. You may shower or bathe, but do not get water in the operated eye during the first three days after surgery. Someone may wash your hair for you as long as the operated eye does not get wet. You may use eye make-up 2 weeks after surgery. d. Reading and TV are permitted. Driving may be resumed as soon as you feel comfortable. Sexual intercourse may be resumed one week after surgery. e. Light walking may be resumed immediately if you feel like it. If you do more strenuous sports activities such as jogging, swimming, bowling, tennis, and golf, or if you have special work requirements discuss these with your doctor before resuming them. Post Op Cataract Sx Combo Drops and 3 - Feb 2016.doc It will take several weeks for your eye to completely heal. Your vision will GRADUALLY improve over this time. Do not be alarmed if your vision is not improving as fast as you had hoped. Each eye is unique and heals differently. We will explain your progress at each postoperative visit. If you have questions please write them down and bring them with you to your next visit. Approximately two weeks after your surgery a refraction test will be performed to see if you will require a distance and/or reading glass change following your surgery. If glasses are needed to optimize your vision, a prescription will be given to you to obtain a temporary lens. Once the eye is completely healed, the refraction usually changes slightly. It may be necessary to do another refraction to refine the vision and give you a permanent lens. Most patients need two refractions during the first six months following cataract surgery. 4. EMERGENCY CARE: a. For the majority of patients, recovery is uneventful. Should you experience significant pain, loss of vision, or flashing lights in the operated eye CALL THE OFFICE IMMEDIATELY. The phone number is: 954-977-8770 5. YAG LASER POSTERIOR CAPSULOTOMY Posterior capsulotomy is a laser procedure that is usually necessary after cataract surgery. Following cataract surgery, a cellophane-like membrane called the capsule is present to help stabilize the implant and to promote healing. The posterior capsule is normally clear. However, with time, this capsule can often become cloudy or wrinkled. This wrinkling or cloudiness can interfere with vision after your cataract surgery in ways similar to the original cataract. If the clouding of the posterior capsule interferes with your vision we will recommend making a laser opening in the capsule to clear the clouding. This opening is made with a painless YAG laser in our office. While the laser is always effective at opening the capsule, as with any surgical procedure, rare complications can occur such as swelling or detachment of the retina, and loss of vision. 6. ENHANCEMENTS OR \u201cTOUCH-UPS\u201d If, after your cataract surgery, you have any residual refractive error, we can modify it after both eyes are completely healed. A LASER enhancement, or \u201ctouch-up\u201d, can help you achieve the best vision possible. Patients who have had refractive surgery such as RK, PRK, or LASIK prior to developing cataracts, many times, require an enhancement. If you have chosen conventional (non-laser) cataract surgery with a standard intraocular lens implant, or have had prior refractive surgery such as RK, PRK, or LASIK, there will be a charge for the enhancement procedure because i",

For the first few days after surgery, you will be using two (or more!) different eye drops. Please wait at least a few minutes between using each of the drops (it does not matter which eye medication you use first). Also, close your eyes for a couple of minutes after placement of any eye drop to help it absorb better. It is normal for the eye to feel a bit scratchy at times and you may use artificial tears 4 times a day as needed. For the first week after surgery, place the eye-shield over the operated eye at night. You may use any adhesive tape that will keep the eye-shield on. Avoid washing your hair for 48 hours to keep water out of the operated eye. Avoid any strenuous activity, heavy lifting, or swimming for the first week after surgery. You should expect the vision to slowly improve over the next several weeks. By the second week after surgery you should be able to resume all your normal activities. I would be pleased if you would take a moment to send me an e-mail via KP.org or leave a message for me at the number below to let me know how things are going- you should be seeing well and the eye comfortable during the second week. If not, please let me know- I will want to see you in the office! Most patients resume driving within a few days after surgery. Of course, you must make a judgment for yourself about your vision. Please do not take any unnecessary risks! It is ok to travel and fly, although you should be somewhere you can readily access KP for care if needed for the first 7-10 days after surgery in the unlikely event of any complications. Eye infection after surgery is rare but serious. If you have significant decrease in vision (compared to the first day or two after cataract surgery), increasing redness of the eye, increased discharge or significant pain lasting over 30 minutes then this is an emergency and you need to be seen. Please call ahead to the eye clinic then come to the office during business hours or go to the emergency department after hours and identify yourself immediately as having a surgical problem for the on-call eye doctor to see you. If you have any questions or concerns after surgery, please call 510-675-2020 for Union City and 510-248-3030 for Fremont. We will typically arrange a follow-up with your optometrist in about 1 month for your new eyeglass prescription. In the meantime, if you wish, you may go to our Optical Store to buy over-the-counter reading glasses or you can use your old prescription glasses until your optometry appointment if you are still comfortable wearing them. Thank you for choosing and trusting KAISER PERMANENTE for your care. Wishing you the best of health, Your ophthalmologist and the eye care staff",

      "text_content": "Rehearsal Guide Title Subtitle Rehearsal Guide Cataract Surgery Recovery preparing people with intellectual disability / autism (ID/A) to successfully recover after cataract surgery Introduction for Caregivers A rehearsal guide contains realistic pictures, concrete ideas, and clear, brief instructions for guiding a person through what can be expected in a specific situation. It includes helpful suggestions for caregivers to follow to make the experience meaningful for the person and increase the likelihood of a successful outcome. This approach is beneficial when supporting people with intellectual disability/autism (ID/A) who are anxious about situations such as doctors\u2019 appointments, hospitalizations, and medical testing. A rehearsal guide provides opportunities for the caregiver to assist the person to learn about a specific situation. It contains information on what is needed and why and explains exactly what can be expected. Such a guide is most effective when it is person-centered and used in conjunction with discussion to allow exploration of specific areas of concern. It can be a powerful tool when used as intended. The expected result is that the person will then experience the situation in a way that supports health and well-being by being prepared and knowing what to expect. The guide can be used at all stages of the situation to facilitate a positive end result. Thank you for taking the time to use this tool to work with self-advocates to improve their health outcomes. hcqu.kepro.com Page - 1 How to Use This Rehearsal Guide For best results, begin to review this rehearsal guide with the person prior to the day of the appointment. Sometimes it will help to review this material with an individual several days or weeks before an appointment; other times, it may be better to wait to review this material until just before the procedure is to take place, perhaps the day before or the morning of the procedure. Together with the individual, determine which will best suit the individual\u2019s needs and abilities in understanding the information provided; however, it is important not to wait until 5 minutes before a procedure to introduce this guide to an individual. Give the individual enough time in advance to become familiar with the procedure based on the pictures and information contained on each page and with the individual\u2019s abilities in mind. It is best to review this guide slowly and to focus on one idea/page at a time, allowing the person to talk and/or ask questions after each idea/page is presented. A caregiver may want to share personal experiences related to having this procedure done but be sure to do so in a positive manner, depicting a positive outcome. For Best Practices \uf0fc Allot time to review this material when the individual is alert and interested in doing so. \uf0fc Ensure that the setting is free from distraction. Based on the individual\u2019s attention span, it may be best to review one page at a time, rather than reviewing an entire guide in one sitting. \uf0fc Explain each picture and practice the suggested exercises with the individual, such as deep breathing, as they appear throughout the guide. \uf0fc On the day of the procedure, take this guide along to continue rehearsing the various steps involved in the procedure. Review each page step-by-step. \uf0fc Remain positive, calm, and upbeat. \uf0fc Remember to offer positive reinforcement throughout the procedure. If the procedure is not able to be completed, focus on positive aspects. If the individual seems upset, talk about it later when they are calm to find out how they felt and what could be changed or improved to have a better outcome the next time. hcqu.kepro.com Page - 2 INTRODUCING THE PROCESS (Name of individual), you are going to be recovering from your cataract surgery on (insert date here).

These procedures were those that generally did not exceed 90 minutes in length and did not require more than 4 hours of recovery or convalescent time. Prior to January 1, 2008, Medicare did not pay an ASC for those procedures that required more than an ASC level of care, or for minor procedures that were normally performed in a physician\u2019s office. CMS published updates to the list of covered surgical procedures for which an ASC may be paid each year. Beginning January 1, 2008, payment is made to ASCs under Part B for all surgical procedures except those that CMS determines may pose a significant safety risk to beneficiaries or that are expected to require an overnight stay when furnished in an ASC. Also, beginning January 1, 2008, separate payment is made to ASCs under Part B for certain ancillary services, such as certain drugs and biologicals, OPPS pass-through devices, brachytherapy sources, and radiology procedures. Medicare does not pay an ASC for procedures that are excluded from the list of covered surgical procedures. Medicare continues to pay ASCs for new technology intraocular lenses and corneal tissue acquisition as it did prior to January 1, 2008. CMS publishes updates to the list of covered surgical procedures for which an ASC may be paid each year. In addition, CMS publishes quarterly updates to the lists of covered surgical procedures and covered ancillary services to establish payment indicators and payment rates for newly created Level II HCPCS and Category III CPT codes. The complete lists of ASC covered surgical procedures and ASC covered ancillary services, the applicable payment indicators, payment rates for each covered surgical procedure and ancillary service before adjustments for regional wage variations, the wage adjusted payment rates, and wage indices are accessible on the CMS Web site at: https://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Medicare-Fee-for-Service- Payment/ASCPayment/index.html . To be paid under this provision, a facility must be certified as meeting the requirements for an ASC and must enter into a written agreement with CMS. The certification process is described in the State Operations Manual. ASCs must accept Medicare\u2019s payment as payment in full for services with respect to those services defined as ASC services. The physician and anesthesiologist may bill and be paid for the professional component of the service also.

      "text_content": "Discharge Instruction following Laparoscopic Cholecystectomy What is Laparoscopic Cholecystectomy? Laparoscopic cholecystectomy is minimally invasive surgical procedure to remove the gallbladder. It is recommended to people who developed gallstones that cause inflammation, pain or infection. The surgery involves a few small incisions, and most people go home the same day and soon return to normal activities. This procedure is often recommended if you develop any problems with it. The laparoscopic procedure is recommended because it has several benefits such as lesser pain, lower risk of complications, quicker recovery and return to regular activities, and smaller wounds and scars. The whole operation is performed under a general anaesthetic and usually lasts between 1 and 2 hours. What is a gallbladder? Your gallbladder is a small, pear-shaped organ on the right side of your abdomen, just beneath your liver. The gallbladder holds a digestive fluid called bile that's released into your small intestine. Gallstones are hardened deposits of digestive fluid that can form in your gallbladder. Bile makes it easier to digest fat. It contains some waste products, including cholesterol and bilirubin, substance created when old red blood cells are destroyed. Gallstones form when cholesterol or bilirubin particles cluster together into a solid lump. People who experience symptoms from their gallstones usually require gallbladder removal surgery. It is not a vital organ and it can be surgically removed if it is causing problems. In some patients, a procedure called an ERCP can be undertaken. A fibre-optic scope (endoscope) is inserted into the gut via the mouth and gullet to retrieve stones stuck in the bile duct. The bottom end of the duct can also be widened at the same time so that any future stones escaping into the duct can pass more easily. Why would I need this procedure? Laparoscopic cholecystectomy is a commonly performed procedure to treat symptoms arising from gallstones as well as to prevent the more serious complications that gallstones can cause. Gallstones may also cause inflammation of the pancreas or yellowing of the skin and eyes and in certain cases, removal of the gallbladder stops these from re-occurring. What are the symptoms that have led to me having this procedure? Gallstones often cause no symptoms and you may not realise you have them, but occasionally they can block the flow of bile and irritate the gallbladder (cholecystitis) or pancreas (pancreatitis). This can cause symptoms such as sudden and intense stomach pain, feeling and being sick and yellowing of the skin and eyes (jaundice). What are the alternatives? Because of the potentially serious complications, we generally recommend surgery to prevent the more serious complications. While surgery is the only recommended treatment, there are some alternative measures suggested. 0976/01/ March 2022 - Surgery Pain Control- Treatment of acute biliary colic primarily involves pain control with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or narcotic pain relievers. Another option for pain control is antispasmodic agents, which are thought to relax and relieve the spasms of the gallbladder. Antibiotic prophylaxis- is not required in low-risk patients undergoing elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy, but it may reduce the incidence of wound infection in high-risk patients. Watchful waiting - is the most important alternative to cholecystectomy in patients with uncomplicated gallstone disease. Symptom relief occurs in a large percentage of the patients, and the risk of developing complications is relatively small. There are other non-surgical alternative such as Oral Dissolution Therapy and Extracorporeal shock-wave lithotripsy (ESWL) but are not commonly used and not very effective and there is a chance of the gallstones to recur in most of the patients. What are the potential risks and side effects? Gallbladder removal surgery is considered to be a safe procedure, but, like any type of surgery, there's a risk of complications. Possible complications include: Infection- Some people develop a wound or internal infection after a gallbladder removal. Bleeding- Bleeding can occur after your operation, although this is rare. If it does occur, you may require a further operation to stop it. Bile leakage- When the gallbladder is removed, special clips are used to seal the tube that connects the gallbladder to the main bile duct. Injury to the bile duct- The bile duct can be damaged during a gallbladder removal. If this happens during surgery, it may be possible to repair it straight away. Injury to the intestine, bowel and blood vessels- The surgical instruments used to remove the gallbladder can also injure surrounding structures, such as the intestine, bowel and blood vessels. Deep vein thrombosis- You may be given special compression stockings to wear after the operation to prevent this happening. Pain- it is expected to feel pain within a few days a",

The glue will fall off over the next 2-3 weeks. Do not pick at the glue, it is firmly attached to your skin \u2022 Some people may experience moderate pain, nausea, or loose stools depending on what you eat after surgery for up to 2 weeks. DIET You have no dietary restrictions after your gallbladder has been removed but it\u2019s a good idea to take it slow and avoid fatty foods that could cause diarrhea and stomach upset. Try to eat a low fat diet for the \u200b first week after surgery while your body adjusts to not having a gallbladder. Fat or oils in your diet (dairy, nuts, salad dressings, etc..) can cause stomach upset and loose stool. This usually improves after a couple of weeks. If loose stool persists for more than a month after surgery contact us for consideration of medication to resolve this problem. WOUND CARE 1. Unless otherwise directed, you may shower daily with your choice of soap and water to keep your incision clean and help reduce the risk of skin infection. 2. DO NOT SOAK! No tubs, pools, or hot springs until you are seen on your follow up appointment \u200b or 2 weeks. Submerging in water increases the risk of infection. LIMITATION 1. DO NO LIFT, PUSH OR PULL MORE THAN 20 lbs. or use your abdominal muscles for 6 weeks after \u200b surgery. This allows time for your incisions to heal and reduces the risk of incisional hernia formation. 2. You should be up and moving around the night of your surgery and walking 5-6 times a day at a minimum there after. FOLLOW UP APPOINTMENT If you have not already done so, call our office (208) 321-4790 and schedule a post operative visit for 10-21 days after your surgery. WHEN TO CALL \u2022 Fever: Temperature greater than 101\u00b0F \u200b \u200b \u2022 Uncontrolled pain \u2022 No bowel movement in 3 days \u2022 Shortness of breath \u2013 New Onset and severe call 911 \u2022 Chest Pressure or pain- New Onset and severe call 911 \u2022 Lower leg swelling \u2022 Persistent Nausea \u2022 Extreme bruising or swelling around the incision \u2022 If you have other questions or concerns PAIN \u200b 1. Use your prescription pain medication \u201cnarcotic\u201d or \u201cnon-narcotic\u201d as directed on the prescription. 2. DO NOT take additional Tylenol (acetaminophen) if your pain medication has Tylenol (acetaminophen) in it. 3. You may take ibuprofen 200 mg tablets: 800mg total every 8 hours OR Aleve (Naproxen) 1 tablet every 12 hours as needed along with your narcotic. 4. Use ice to decrease the swelling: Wrap a ziplock bag of ice in a towel and place it on and off your incisions every 15-30 minutes as needed for the first 2 days. It will help decrease inflammation. BOWEL CARE 1. Start bowel care IMMEDIATELY after surgery to prevent constipation. It is very common and is caused by certain surgeries, anesthesia, and especially narcotics. Listed below are different options for you that are available over the counter at your local pharmacy or grocery store. \u2022 Stool Softeners (colace & docusate calcium) soften the stool, making it easier to pass. Stool softeners can be most effective if you drink plenty of water throughout the day. \u2022 Laxatives: Such as Correctol, Ex-Lax, and Senokot make stool move faster through the intestines by irritating the lining of the intestines. Regular use of stimulant laxatives is NOT recommended. Stimulant laxatives change the tone and feeling in the large intestine, and you can become dependent on using laxatives all the time to have a bowel movement. 2. Our recommendation to start BEFORE the day of surgery- Colace 1 capsule twice a day OR \u200b Miralax 1 scoop twice a day. 3.

      "text_content": "Laparoscopic Inguinal Hernia Repair Post-Op Instructions Post-Op To-Do List: Take Acetaminophen and Ibuprofen tablets every 6 hours together for 2-5 days Do not do anything strenuous for 2 weeks after surgery Please review the post op instructions below if you have questions Pain Soreness or pain at the incisions, the lower abdomen, and groin after surgery is normal. Pain will be worse with movement, changing positions from laying to seated to standing. Male patients may notice new pain in the testicles after surgery. This is normal and will go away over time. Most of our patients take only tylenol and ibuprofen for pain management after surgery. We recommend taking the following every 6 hours for the first few days after surgery as needed (both can be taken together at the same time): - 650mg to 1g of acetaminophen (Tylenol) - 400mg to 600mg of ibuprofen (Advil or Motrin) If you are experiencing significant pain that is preventing you from going on a walk or falling asleep, please call the office for a prescription for oxycodone. This medication will cause constipation, so we recommend the following: - Fiber supplement (Citrucel or Metamucil) - Stool softener (Colace) or natural laxative (Senokot) - Laxative only if unable to have a bowel movement for a few days (Milk of Magnesia) Incision The incisions are closed with dissolvable sutures - these do not need to be removed. You have glue over your incisions with dissolvable stitches under the skin. You should leave this glue in place as long as it is well stuck in the area. If it peels up at the edges (usually 10-14 days after surgery), you may pull it off. Otherwise it will fall off on its own. Your incisions may feel hard about 7-10 days after surgery. This is due to scar tissue, and is a normal part of healing. Bruising in the groin and genitals is normal after surgery. MALE patients may find that your scrotum or penis will become discolored, and you will have swelling in the region of your hernia and incision. FEMALE patients may find that your labia will become swollen and discolored. This discoloration and swelling will resolve with time. Some patients will feel a firm lump in the area where their hernia used to bulge. Most of the time this is fluid in this area - called a \"seroma\" - this will resolve within a few months. Many patients have used Arnica Montana, either as a gel or orally, to reduce swelling and bruising after surgery. Arnica is a safe, homeopathic medicine that works well in many patients. Most natural food stores will carry it. Bathing You may shower at any time after surgery. Please avoid baths, hot tubs, pools, or soaking in water for 2 weeks after surgery, as this can increase your risk of an infection. Activity Following surgery, you are encouraged to do as much walking as is comfortable. You may climb stairs, taking them one at a time and slowly. We recommend walking at a leisurely pace for the first 2 weeks. Avoid exercise, strenuous activity, lifting over 25lbs, and repetitive actions for 2 weeks after surgery. After 2 weeks, you may slowly resume these activities, but do so slowly and progressively, and listen to your body if it is telling you to stop or slow down. You may drive 24 hours after surgery if you feel up to it, as long as you are not taking any prescription pain medications. We typically recommend you avoid driving for 48-72 hours unless necessary. Precautions Although not commonly seen, any incision is susceptible to infection. If you develop a fever of 101 degrees or above, have unexpected pain, redness or pus draining from the incision, please contact our office. Your pain and swelling should gradually improve after the second or third postoperative day. If you have new, constant pain after feeling good for a couple of days, please contact our office. Follow-up You will have a post-operative appointment scheduled for somewhere between 2 and 4 weeks after surgery. If this has not been scheduled yet, or if you need to reschedule, please contact our office. Hernia recovery during cold and flu season The winter months bring lots of colds and sometimes the flu. If you find yourself needing to cough or sneeze, it\u2019s often helpful to place a pillow or your hand over your incisions. This provides some support and comfort, and will hopefully decrease your pain when you cough or sneeze. Sharp pain is not uncommon after a cough or sneeze, and lingering effects should resolve in a day or two. It's very unlikely that the hernia will return as a result of this. Post-op FAQ: Below are questions that patients often ask us before and after surgery. This was created to help you better prepare for the day of surgery and for recovery. While these answers do not substitute for an appointment with us, they are created to help you remember what may have been said in the office during your consultation. Will I be able to walk after surgery? Yes. We want everyone to walk after surgery. Rarely, the local anesthesia we use can cause your l",

      "text_content": "Laparoscopic Inguinal Hernia Repair Post-op Instructions Diet \uf0a7 Start with clear liquids today to prevent nausea, vomiting and constipation, (soup, Jell-O, juices, popsicles, and carbonated beverages.) Drink plenty of water (at least 8 large glasses a day.) \uf0a7 Advance to regular diet tomorrow. Eat lots of whole grains, fruits, green leafy vegetables. Avoid foods that cause constipation such as dairy products, red meat, processed foods such as pizza, frozen dinners, pasta, and sugar products such as cakes, pies, pastries, doughnuts and drinks containing caffeine. Medication \uf0a7 Take pain medication ordered by your doctor. Take crackers or toast with pain medication while on clear liquids. \uf0a7 _______________________________________________________________ \uf0a7 Take stool softeners as prescribed. \uf0a7 _______________________________________________________________ Activity \uf0a7 Rest for the next 24 hours. \uf0a7 Walk to bathroom and other short distances only, on night of surgery. \uf0a7 On next day, get up and walk as tolerated. \uf0a7 Do not make sudden position changes; if lying down; sit for a minute before standing. \uf0a7 No lifting greater than 10 pounds for two (2) weeks. Dressing \uf0a7 There will be 3 to 4 small incisions in the abdominal area. Your incisions will be closed with skin clips or sutures as determined by your surgeon. Dressings will cover your incisions. \uf0a7 Keep your dressing clean and dry for 48 hours. \uf0a7 You may remove the outer dressing after 48 hours. After you have removed the dressing, you may cover your incisions with Band-Aids or leave them open to air, which ever is more comfortable. \uf0a7 If you have steri strips (thin strips of white tape), leave them in place until your appointment with your doctor. The steri strips may fall off on their own in approximately 10-14 days. \uf0a7 If you have skin glue, a topical skin adhesive, this will naturally slough off your skin in 5 to 10 days. Do not rub, scratch, or pick at the skin glue. Do not apply any medications or any products to wound while skin glue is in place. Bathing \uf0a7 May shower after 48 hours. Gently pat-dry wound area with soft clean towel. \uf0a7 No bathing, immersion or swimming for at least two (2) weeks. Laparoscopic Inguinal Hernia Repair Post-op Instructions Miscellaneous \uf0a7 No alcohol or driving for 24 hours after surgery or while taking pain medicine. \uf0a7 Do not make any personal or business decisions for 24 hours. \uf0a7 You should have a responsible adult with you for the rest of the day and night. Special Instruction \uf0a7 Avoid constipation and foods that cause constipation. \uf0a7 Avoid straining with bowel movements. What to Expect \uf0a7 Right shoulder discomfort, chest tightness, bilateral shoulder discomfort for 24 to 48 hours after surgery, gradually this will go away. It is caused by carbon dioxide used to inflate your abdomen during the procedure. Carbon dioxide is a gas, and like all gases, travels upwards, settling on your chest and shoulders. \uf0a7 Soreness in the abdominal area similar to an ache you would feel after starting a new exercise program involving your abdominal muscles. This ache will gradually go away within a few days. \uf0a7 Your abdomen may be distended for a few days after surgery. \uf0a7 There may be a large black or blue area (bruise), on your abdomen to your hip.

      "text_content": "Post Operative Instructions: Robotic Incisional Hernia Repair After your Robotic incisional hernia surgery it is very common to feel bloating and shoulder pain for several days afterwards. A heating pad can be very helpful for the shoulder pain. Typically the bloating resolves on its own with walking and deep breathing. Pain Control: It is recommended that you begin taking anti-inflammatory medications after surgery. Typically it is recommended that you take scheduled Ibuprofen and Tylenol afterwards. The medications should be alternated every 3 hours. In between the doses of Ibuprofen and Tylenol, if you have significant pain, feel free to take the narcotic medications as needed. If you do not have significant pain, do NOT take the narcotics. If you do take the narcotic medications, please take a dose of milk of magnesia with the narcotics to prevent constipation. Example: Noon \u2013 Tylenol 650mg (If still having significant pain, take narcotics 1 hour later with 15cc milk of magnesia ) 3pm \u2013 Ibuprofen 600mg (If still having significant pain, take narcotics 1 hour later with 15cc milk of magnesia) 6pm \u2013 Tylenol 650mg (If still having significant pain, take narcotics 1 hour later with 15cc milk of magnesia) 9pm \u2013 Ibuprofen 600mg Ice is also very helpful especially placed on the belly button incision and can be used for up to 48 hours. (For those with On-Q pain catheters: Feel free to remove the catheters 3 days after surgery. To remove the catheters, simple peel off the clear plastic dressing and pull the catheters out gently. Be aware that they are about 10 inches long. Place a small band-aid over the opening.) Phone (503) 914-0024 l Fax (503) 914-0025 l www.northwestmis.com Diet: There are no specific dietary restrictions after hernia surgery. Activity: For the first few days after surgery, you may not feel like being very active due to discomfort. A simple rule is that \u201cif it hurts, don\u2019t do it\u201d. Limit your activity to walking in the beginning. Going up and down stairs, going outside, and driving are all fine to do after surgery (do NOT drive while taking narcotics, however). Any more significant strenuous activity, wait until the pain is completely gone. Once the pain is completely gone, feel free to begin light exercise and daily activities. Wound Care: The wounds are covered by a skin glue. The skin glue is completely waterproof so you can shower the night after your surgery. Please do not rub the skin glue too vigorously as it may peel off early. After showering, leave the wounds open to air, they do not need to be covered. Typically the glue will flake off after 4-6 weeks. Please do not peel the glue off. Return to Work: You may return to work as early as several days to a week after surgery. The timing of when to return to work depends on your level of discomfort and the type of work you do. You are the best judge of your pain levels and the type of work required of you. It is not recommended to return to work too early as you may be quite fatigued and uncomfortable. When to call: Please contact your doctor\u2019s office if you are experiencing: shortness of breath, worsening pain despite medications, fevers of 101 degrees or higher, nausea/vomiting, severe redness or drainage at the wound, or any other issues of concern.

Advance your diet as tolerated. \u2022 Recommended pain management regimen: o Meloxicam (If prescribed): 1 tablet daily OR Ibuprofen: 400-600mg every 8hrs as needed. \u25aa These are anti-inflammatory drugs. Do not take ibuprofen and meloxicam together. If you have a sensitivity to anti-inflammatories, history of stomach ulcers, or kidney disease do not take anti- inflammatories. o Tylenol: This is over the counter. Take 1000mg 3x/daily as needed. Max of 4000mg/24hrs. o Oxycodone (or other prescribed narcotic medication): 1-2 tablets every 4-6 hours as needed for breakthrough pain. \u2022 Constipation is to be expected while on narcotic pain medications. Most patients do not have their first bowel movement until at least 3 days after surgery. While utilizing narcotics, you should remain on an over-the-counter stool softener such as Colace or Docusate. Fiber supplementation with Metamucil or Citrucel is also recommended. For severe constipation, Miralax, milk of magnesia or a fleets enema can be helpful. Do not use the enema if you have any chronic kidney diseases such as renal failure. \u2022 Swelling is to be expected around your genitals. THIS CAN SOMETIMES BE ALARMING. It will typically return to normal within 1-2 weeks typically. \u2022 For about 1 week after surgery, wearing supportive underwear that will hold your genitals in a relatively fixed position (for example, tighty whities or boxer briefs) may help reduce swelling and improve comfort. \u2022 Nausea is a common complaint post op. This can be associated with narcotic pain medications, anesthesia, as well as with severe constipation. Try to minimize your use of narcotic pain medications as soon as able. If persistent vomiting, fevers or chills occur, please call the office at 303.449.3642.

The adhesive normally lasts approximately 1-2 weeks. If it falls off sooner, do not be alarmed. You can expect each of the incisions to form a hard knot beneath the skin. Bruising is especially common, especially in your genital area or around your navel. If you notice any areas of increasing warmth or redness, fevers, or chills, please call the office at 303.449.3642. \u2022 Driving may be resumed when off all narcotic pain medications and you can turn or twist your body comfortably without hesitation. \u2022 Urinary retention is a common problem after groin hernia surgery. If you are unable to urinate within 8 hours after surgery or if you feel uncomfortable prior, please call the office at 303.449.3642. \u2022 You may shower the day of surgery. Avoid soaking your incisions in a bath tub or hot tub until you have been seen in follow-up. \u2022 Activity limitations include no lifting more than 30 pounds for one week after surgery. \u2022 Schedule a post-operative visit 2 weeks after surgery.

There is no consensus onmanagement of complicated abdominalhernias. The main matter of debate is about the use ofmesh in case of intestinal resection and thetypeof mesh to be used. Wound infectionis the most common complication encountered and represents an immenseburden especially in thepresence ofa mesh. The recurrence rate is an important topic that influences the final outcome. A World Society of EmergencySurgery (WSES)Consensus Conference was held inBergamo inJuly 2013 with theaim to define recommendations for emergency repair of abdominal wall hernias inadults. This document represents the executive summary of theconsensus conference approved bya WSES expert panel. In2016, the guidelines have been revised and updated according to themost recent available literature.

BOARD CERTIFIED IN GENERAL SURGERY Corie L. Seelbach, D.O. POST OPERATIVE GUIDELINES: ROBOTIC INGUINAL HERNIA REPAIR ACTIVITY You just underwent major surgery. Of course you\u2019ll want to prevent a recurrence. This means DO NOT: LIFT, TUG, PUSH, PULL anything greater than 25 lbs x 6 weeks. If it hurts, don\u2019t do it! It is OK to go up and down stairs, just conserve your trips and use the handrail. You may drive when you are able to hop without pain (go up on your toes and drop down onto your heels. Once you can do this painlessly, you may resume driving a car.) Sexual activity may resume at your own discretion. Of course, be wise, and be gentle. Stop or change activity if you feel ANY pain or discomfort. Most people need about a week or so before they can painlessly resume sexual activity. PAIN CONTROL You should expect the pain from the surgery to be in the mild to moderate category. With this in mind, you will not need heavy pain medications. The following regimen of medication is what works for most people and is recommended by our practice. If you follow these guidelines you are unlikely to experience any levels of heavy discomfort. TYLENOL XTRA STRENGTH\u20262 pills every 6 hr ALEVE\u20261 pill every 12 hr (it is completely safe to combine these drugs, together; TAKE THEM WITH FOOD) (Generics are just as good as name brand: Tylenol = acetaminophen; Aleve=naproxen) >>>use this combination for 3 consecutive days, then you may decrease to using the Tylenol/Aleve combination only when needed. >>>We recommend using this around-the-clock for the first three days, even if you think you don\u2019t really need it. If not, the pain may escalate and you will likely find it difficult to get it back under control. PRESCRIPTION PAIN MEDICATION - THIS IS A NARCOTIC / A CONTROLLED SUBSTANCE. - use ONLY when the Tylenol/Aleve combination doesn\u2019t work - NOT designed to be used as a first line drug, but should be thought of as a RESCUE DRUG that is used IN COMBINATION with the TYLENOL/ALEVE. - Most people never use the narcotic at all. - NEVER USE THE NARCOTIC AS A SLEEP AID - NEVER USE THE NARCOTIC AS PAIN PREVENTION COMMON POST-OPERATIVE ISSUES: \uf0b7 Constipation is a common post-operative complaint from the anesthesia. o Using a fiber product is recommended (Benefiber, Metamucil, etc) & Drink plenty of non-caffeinated beverages = water! o You may use MIRALAX (polyethylene glycol) - mix as directed. Use 2-3 times per day and then as needed. \uf0b7 Urinary Retention is another POSSIBLE post-anesthesia issue = if you are unable to empty your bladder, CALL US ASAP! WOUND CARE Your incisions are (***typically) closed with glue, so they are immediately waterproof. You may shower, tube bath, swim whenever you desire. (***If your incisions are closed with paper steri-strips, then you may shower the day after your surgery, but you should wait approximately 1 week to tub bathe or swim in a pool/lake.) Bruising is normal and may even extend down into the scrotum and penis. CONTACT US WITH ANY PROBLEMS Call with ANY concerns. The office phone (586-228-0550) is supported, 24 hours a day. If you need to speak with a physician after hours, call the office and simply follow the prompts. When you leave a message, simply leave your name, phone number and the type of surgery you had; a physician will call you back. Please do not leave messages attempting to explain the problem. 17375 Hall Road, Macomb, Michigan 48044 www.nesg.com P: 586-228-0550 F: 586-228-8830",

      "text_content": "Caring for myself after Laparoscopic Appendectomy What is Laparoscopy Appendectomy?  NIDDK Laparoscopy appendectomy is a surgery to treat appendicitis \u2013 infection of the appendix. During laparoscopic surgery, surgeons use several smaller incisions and special surgical tools that they feed through the incisions to remove your appendix. Laparoscopic surgery leads to fewer complications, such as hospital-related infections, and has a shorter recovery time. How will care for myself after the surgery? How will I care for my incision? \u2022 You may shower your incisions once home. \u2022 Gently wash incisions and pat dry. Leave open to the air and dry. \u2022 Avoid powders or creams. \u2022 Do not take tub baths or hot tubs. \u2022 Do not swim until the incisions are completely healed. \u2022 Wear loose comfortable clothing. Tight fitting clothing may irritate the skin around your incision sites. \u2022 If steri strips are present, these will fall off in about 1-2 weeks. Do not pull them off earlier. How will I manage my pain at home? The best strategy for controlling your pain after surgery is around the clock pain control with Tylenol (acetaminophen) and Motrin (ibuprofen or Advil). \u201cAround the clock\u201d means taking medications on a set schedule day and night. Alternating these medications allows you to maximize your pain control. In addition to Tylenol and Motrin, you can use heating pads or ice packs on your incisions to help reduce your pain. Minimally Invasive Surgery - 1 - How will I alternate over-the-counter pain medication? You will take a dose of pain medication every three hours: \u2022 Start by taking 650 mg of Tylenol (2 pills of 325 mg) \u2022 3 hours later take 600 mg of Motrin (3 pills of 200 mg) \u2022 3 hours later take 650 mg of Tylenol \u2022 3 hours after that take 600 mg of Motrin. Example - if your first dose of Tylenol is at 12:00 PM this would be your schedule for the day: Time: Dose: 12:00 PM Tylenol 650 mg (2 pills of 325 mg) 3:00 PM Motrin 600 mg (3 pills of 200 mg) 6:00 PM Tylenol 650 mg (2 pills of 325 mg) 9:00 PM Motrin 600 mg (3 pills of 200 mg) Continue alternating every 3 hours Follow this schedule around-the-clock for at least 3 days after surgery, or until you feel that it is no longer needed. What if I have an opioid medication? Your doctor may also prescribe an opioid pain medication for you (a narcotic). Take the opioid only if you need it. You can take it in addition to the over-the counter medications schedule described above, or you can replace one of the over-the-counter doses with a dose of the opioid. Make sure you follow the amount and schedule your doctor ordered in the opioid prescription. Use the table on the last page of this handout to keep track of the medications you are taking. Minimally Invasive Surgery Taking Care of Myself after Laparoscopy Appendectomy - 2 - Important \u2022 Do not take more than 3000mg of Tylenol or 3200mg of Motrin in a 24-hour period. If you take an opioid, check to see if it contains acetaminophen and add the amount to your daily intake.) \u2022 Do not drink alcohol or drive while taking an opioid pain medication. What are my diet instructions? \u2022 Return to your same diet as before surgery. Taking smaller portions and eating more frequently during the day o may help in transitioning to your regular diet (6-8 small meals per day). \u2022 Avoid constipation. Drink plenty of water and caffeine-free fluids. Take stool softener if you are taking prescription pain medications (opioids). What are my activity instructions? \u2022 Do not lift anything greater than 5 \u2013 10 pounds for 6 weeks. \u2022 Avoid strenuous activities such as vacuuming, lifting children and groceries, doing laundry, moving furniture, mowing lawns and sports activities. \u2022 Do not drive until your first post-op visit. \u2022 You may climb stairs in moderation. \u2022 Walk as much as you are able. Walking is the only exercise allowed during the first 6 weeks after surgery. \u2022 Resume sexual activity as discussed at your first post-op visit. When should I call my doctor? Call if you have any of the signs and symptoms that may indicate an infection: \u2022 Temperature above 101\u00b0F. \u2022 Significant increase in wound pain or discomfort. \u2022 Excessive redness, swelling, or drainage from the incision sites. It is normal to have some swelling and bruising in the groin area. \u2022 The incisions begin to open. Minimally Invasive Surgery Taking Care of Myself after Laparoscopy Appendectomy - 3 - You should also call if you have any of these signs or symptoms: \u2022 Nausea \u2022 Vomiting \u2022 Chills \u2022 Profuse (excessive) sweating \u2022 Diarrhea \u2022 Constipation \u2022 Inability to urinate or completely empty bladder What is the number to call? Call the General Surgery Call Center at (734) 936-5738. \u2022 If you call after business hours (Monday-Friday between 8am-5pm) the Call Center will connect you with your surgery team. If you had your surgery at St. Joseph Mercy Chelsea Hospital, please make sure to mention this. What is my follow-up care? You will return to the clinic for your follow-up visit about two weeks af",

There will ultimately be no food intolerances after appendectomy. \u2022 Constipation is to be expected while on narcotic pain medications. Most patients do not have their first bowel movement until at least 3 days after surgery. While utilizing narcotics, you should remain on an over the counter stool softener such as Colace or docusate. Fiber supplementation with Metamucil or Citrucel is also recommended. For severe constipation Miralax, Milk of Magnesia, or a fleets enema can be helpful. Do not use the enema if you have any chronic kidney diseases such as renal failure. \u2022 Pain is a common complaint after laparoscopic or open surgery. Shoulder pain is an especially frequent complaint after laparoscopic surgery. A protected heating pad applied to your shoulder can sometimes help with shoulder pain. It should resolve within 1-2 days. Make sure to utilize the prescribed narcotic pain medications as recommended. If no sensitivity to anti-inflammatory medications or ulcer history exists, ibuprofen (400-600mg) every 6-8 hours is an excellent alternative in addition to or as a substitute to your narcotic. \u2022 Nausea is a common complaint post op. This can be associated with narcotic pain medications, general anesthesia, as well as with severe constipation. Try to minimize your narcotic pain medications as soon as able. If vomiting, fevers or chills occur, please call the office at 303.449.3642. \u2022 Your incisions are closed with dissolvable sutures and covered with glue. The glue normally last approximately 1-2 weeks. If it comes off sooner, do not be alarmed. You can expect each of the incisions to form a hard knot beneath the skin. Bruising is especially common. If you notice any areas of increasing warmth or redness, fevers, or chills, please call the office at 303.449.3642. \u2022 You may shower the day of surgery if skin glue is used (otherwise please wait to shower until the following day). Avoid soaking your incisions in a bath tub or hot tub until you have been seen in follow-up. \u2022 Driving may be resumed when off all narcotic pain medications and you can turn or twist your body comfortably without hesitation. \u2022 Activity limitations include no lifting more than 30 pounds for two weeks after surgery. \u2022 Schedule a post-operative visit 7-14 days after surgery. If one has not been arranged before surgery, please call the office at 303.449.3642 to coordinate.",

It is normal to feel a knot under your surgical incision for several months after surgery. 5) You are able to take a shower 24 hours after surgery. Dry off the surgical incision after showering and cover with dry gauze if needed. 6) Antibiotics need to be taken as prescribed until they are completed. Diet: You may advance your diet as tolerated after surgery. If you experience nausea and vomiting after surgery start on a clear liquid diet and call the office. Activity: For 6 weeks after surgery 1) No heavy lifting over 20 lbs. 2) No strenuous exercise such as push-ups, sit-ups or abdominal straining 3) Walking is encouraged. 4) Normal daily activities are encouraged. 5) Running and biking are allowed when you feel up to it. 6) No driving until you are pain free and no longer using your pain medication. 7) Avoid extended bed rest. Constipation and bloating: 1) You should have a bowel movement within 3 days of surgery. If you are constipated, increase your water intake and use an over-the-counter stool softener such as mineral oil or a laxative such as Milk of Magnesia as directed on the bottle. Pain medication often causes constipation. 2) If you feel bloated increase your activity. Call our office if: 1) You develop any unusual signs or symptoms such as tenderness, bleeding, redness, or drainage at the surgery site. 2) You have a temperature of 100.5 degrees or higher. 3) You have shortness of breath upon exertion.

Upon discharge you may begin to feel some discomfort for which you may take: Panadol/Panadeine/Panadeine Forte, 2 tablets every 6 hours regularly for the first 48-72 hours. Anti-inflammatory e.g. Nurofen can be used in addition if required. If your pain is not controlled with the above measure contact WPRS for advice. Wound Care If you have a dressing in place then please keep dry and intact, unless you are informed otherwise. Certain dressings (mefix and tegaderm) can be wet and patted dry. If your dressing falls off, do not be concerned as it will not harm the operative site. You should contact WPRS during office hours for advice regarding the dressing. If any bleeding occurs upon discharge, please apply pressure to the site for 10 minutes. If bleeding continues, repeat the above. If bleeding persist contact WPRS or SWHC A&E. (contact details below) Small amounts of ooze from your wound is normal. Please consult WPRS if you are concerned by the amount or type of discharge. Bruising and minimal swelling can be expected around the wound, but this should remain stable and improve in following days. Activity Gentle home activity is recommended for the first 2-4 weeks. Avoid heavy lifting, strenuous exercise or activity for 6 weeks. 2-4 weeks following your surgery you can consider returning to driving, if you feel comfortable and safe to do so. Exercise your ankles, calves whilst in your recovery to minimise your risk for deep vein thrombosis. Diet After most abdominal surgeries, the gut experiences some form of paralysis (laziness). This manifest in the form of bloating, nausea and/or vomiting. Pain medication can contribute to this, therefore use pain medication as prescribed with a high fibre diet. Gut motility/activity also differs from person to person. For this reason, we cannot give strict guidelines. Normally start with clear fluids after surgery or the next day. We progress to full fluid/light diet in the following day or 2. Day 2-3 As your gut starts to work (rumble) and you have bowel actions, you can gradually pace yourself back to your normal diet. This doesn\u2019t mean you can eat what you want when home. You will still need to be gentle on the gut and take it easy and slow with the reintroduction of oral intake. Follow-up Day 7-10 post procedure you will have a post-operative appointment at WPRS. WPRS staff will have attached an appointment card to this handout advising you of this. If you haven\u2019t received a card or appointment, please contact the WPRS rooms on (03) 5562 5330. If you have any concerns please contact WPRS on (03) 5562 5330. - Within clinic hours your call will be transferred to clinical nurse and managed appropriately. - After hours you may leave a message or your call will be diverted to the on-call Surgeon.

GENERAL AND ONCOLOGIC SURGERY OF THE BREAST AND ABDOMEN 11 Overlook Road, Suite 160, Summit, NJ 07901, Tel: (908) 598-0966 Post-Operative Care Instructions for Laparoscopic and Open Appendectomy You have just had an appendectomy, whether it was done laparoscopically or via traditional opened fashion, the internal anatomic procedure was exactly the same. Please follow my instructions to help minimize pain and recovery after. Call the office as soon as possible for a post-operative appointment. WOUND CARE: \u2022 If you had an opened operation you may have clips, which were placed at the time of your procedure. You may shower over these clips. You also may apply Bacitracin or Neosporin ointment over the clips as well. \u2022 If you had a laparoscopic procedure, you have skin glue over the wounds. Please leave this in place until you see me. You may shower over the wounds. \u2022 You may notice some blood under the glue or dressing. This is quite common and unless it is a large amount, it is not a cause for concern. If there is a bubble of blood under the plastic dressing, I would advise making a tiny opening with the tip of a scissor or a pin and gently squeeze the blood out onto a gauze pad or tissue. Then, just continue to allow the dressing to stay intact. If the blood is leaking out from under the dressing, I would recommend getting some sterile gauze and tape and placing it over the dressing for the first twenty-four to forty-eight hours until the leakage of blood stops. \u2022 The most common occurrence after an appendectomy is a wound Infection. This will evidence itself by puffiness and redness around the wound. You also may have increasing pain rather than decreasing pain as time goes along. Certainly, if puss or bleeding is draining from the wound in significant amounts, this would be another sign. In any of these cases, please call the office immediately as I may need to treat this infection both physically and with antibiotics. PAIN CONTROL: \u2022 By the time you have been discharged from the hospital your pain should be decreasing. I probably have sent you home on a narcotic, which is Percocet or Vicodin. It is important that you relieve your pain, however remember that these medications will constipate you so do not use them too extensively. It is also permissible to take anti-inflammatory medication along with the narcotic. This may be Advil or Aleve (over- the-counter) or I may have given you Celebrex as a prescription. These medications should be taken with food. If you have stomach upset with them, please discontinue them. \u2022 It is common for wounds to hurt most when you are trying to fall asleep. This Is because you have no external stimuli to distract you. Also, as you begin to increase your activity you may notice soreness around the wound. The anti-inflammatory medication is quite helpful for this kind of soreness. You may use a heating pad on the wound, but be careful not to burn yourself as the wound may be slightly numb. Remember you may have pain on and off for three to six months as you heal and resume normal activities. This pain does not necessarily indicate an actual Internal problem. It is simply indicative of the normal healing process. PO LAP APPE - P.1 MARC MANDEL, M.D., F.A.C.S. GENERAL AND ONCOLOGIC SURGERY OF THE BREAST AND ABDOMEN 11 Overlook Road, Suite 160, Summit, NJ 07901, Tel: (908) 598-0966 ACTIVITY: \u2022 Initially you may walk or climb stairs only. After the first ten days or so after surgery you may begin light lifting. You may also begin to drive (provided you could drive before surgery!). Beginning the first two weeks after both traditional and laparoscopic surgery you may begin to lift light-weight objects. Two weeks after laparoscopic surgery you may return to your full activity. If you have had opened surgery, I would recommend waiting a full three weeks prior to beginning full activity and heavy exercise. Remember, being a little patient in the beginning will allow the wound to become more comfortable more quickly. \u2022 You may engage in, sexual activity after forty-eight hours. Obviously, adjustments may need to be made for comfort. \u2022 You may shower starting on post-operative day two, unless otherwise instructed. Certainly, you probably have not been discharged from the hospital until day five or six, so that you may shower by the time you get home. You may not bathe for one week. I do not want the wound to be soaked. You may, however, stand with your back to the shower and let water gently run over the waterproof dressing. DIET: \u2022 Water is your friend. You should drink approximately eight glasses of water a day. This will make you feel better and keep your bowel movements nice and soft. \u2022 Staying away from greasy or fatty foods, which may tend to nauseate you, for the first three or four days When you have begun eating. BOWEL MOVEMENTS: \u2022 Your initial bowel movements in the hospital may have been loose and begun to have firmed up by the time you have gone hom",

      "text_content": "SAGES Society of American Gastrointestinal and Endoscopic Surgeons http://www.sages.org Guidelines for Laparoscopic Appendectomy I. Preamble The laparoscopic approach to appendectomy has gained wide acceptance over the last 15 years as a means of improved diagnostic accuracy and wound complication rate over the open procedure. Despite a breadth of data and widespread adoption of the technique, there continues to be controversy regarding the advantages of this approach in hastening postoperative recovery, as well as its use in the management of complicated appendicitis. The following guidelines provide recommendations to surgeons for the laparoscopic management of patients with both simple and complicated appendicitis. II. Disclaimer Guidelines for clinical practice are intended to indicate preferable approaches to medical problems as established by experts in the field. These recommendations will be based on existing data or a consensus of expert opinion when little or no data are available. Guidelines are applicable to all physicians who address the clinical problem(s) without regard to specialty training or interests, and are intended to indicate the preferable, but not necessarily the only acceptable approaches. Guidelines are intended to be flexible. Given the wide range of specifics in any health care problem, the surgeon must always choose the course best suited to the individual patient and the variables in existence at the moment of decision. Guidelines are developed under the auspices of the Society of American Gastrointestinal Endoscopic Surgeons and its various committees, and approved by the Board of Governors. Each clinical practice guideline has been systematically researched, reviewed and revised by the guidelines committee, and reviewed by an appropriate multidisciplinary team. The recommendations are therefore considered valid at the time of its production based on the data available. Each guideline is scheduled for periodic review to allow incorporation of pertinent new developments in medical research knowledge, and practice. III. Definitions See SAGES The Definitions Document: A Reference for Use of SAGES Guidelines (01/2009) IV. Utilization of Laparoscopy for Appendicitis Guideline: The indications for appendectomy are identical whether performed laparoscopically or open. (level III, Grade A) For the purpose of this guideline, it is recognized that the clinician has determined operative intervention for presumed appendicitis is indicated. When the clinician is evaluating a patient with possible appendicitis, the risk and benefit of each diagnostic test and evaluation should be taken into account during the workup. The use of laparoscopy to establish the diagnosis of 1 / 7 SAGES Society of American Gastrointestinal and Endoscopic Surgeons http://www.sages.org appendicitis is addressed in the SAGES Guideline for Diagnostic Laparoscopy (SAGES Publication #0012). General considerations when deciding to proceed laparoscopically include availability of trained staff and equipment, ability and training of surgeon, and the patient\u2019s ability to tolerate general anesthesia and pneumoperitoneum. Previous laparotomy is not an absolute contraindication to a laparoscopic approach. V. Patient Selection A. Uncomplicated Appendicitis GUIDELINE: Laparoscopic appendectomy is a safe and effective method for treatment uncomplicated appendicitis and may be used as an alternative to standard open appendectomy. (level I, grade A) 1. Length of operation, post-operative pain, return to work. Multiple randomized controlled studies have demonstrated the safety and efficiency of laparoscopic appendectomy compared with open appendectomy for the treatment of acute appendicitis. Generally, these studies involve 200 patients or less 1 but some larger experiences have also been reported [2,3]. Although the differences between the two approaches have been small, most studies show that the laparoscopic operation is longer, but associated with a shorter hospital stay and possibly with a more rapid return to work. A meta-analysis of 28 trials available by 1998 4 found that the laparoscopic approach took about 16 minutes longer but resulted in less post-operative pain on day one, shorter hospital stays (15 hours) and quicker return to full activities (5-9 days sooner). Complication rates were comparable, except that wound infections were slightly lower after laparoscopic appendectomy. More recent updates by these authors [5,6] analyzing 45 and 54 studies confirm that the open procedure is shorter (12 minutes) but results in more pain and longer stays. Wound infections occurred about half as often with the laparoscopic approach but deep pelvic abscesses were twice as frequent. Because of the lack of clarity of results from clinical trials, population based studies of up to 150,000 cases looking at the results by 1CD-9 codes for laparoscopic and open appendectomy have been analyzed to sample a broader range of patients [7,8].

Based on the 2023 HAI data results published in the NHSN\u2019s HAI Progress Report, about a 2% increase in the SSI standardized infection ratio (SIR) related to all NHSN operative procedure categories combined compared to the previous year2. In addition, the 2023 HAI data found a 3% significant increase in SIR related to the Surgical Care Improvement Project (SCIP) NHSN operative procedure categories compared to the previous year2. Additional SSI HAI data can be found in the annual HAI Progress Report2. While advances have been made in infection control practices, including improved operating room ventilation, sterilization methods, barriers, surgical technique, and availability of CDC 9 - 1 January 2025 Procedure-associated Module SSI Events antimicrobial prophylaxis, SSIs remain a substantial cause of morbidity, prolonged hospitalization, and mortality. It is reported, SSI accounts for 20% of all HAIs and is associated to a 2-to 11-fold increase in the risk of mortality with 75% of SSI-associated deaths directly attributable to the SSI3,4. SSI is the most costly HAI type with an estimated annual cost of $3.3 billion, and extends hospital length of stay by 9.7 days, with cost of hospitalization increased by more than $20,000 per admission3,5. Surveillance of SSI with feedback of appropriate data to surgeons has been shown to be an important component of strategies to reduce SSI risk6-9. A successful surveillance program includes the use of epidemiologically-sound infection definitions and effective surveillance methods, stratification of SSI rates according to risk factors associated with SSI development, and data feedback7,8.

The service is responsible for all anesthesia administered in the hospital. Interpretive Guidelines \u00a7482.52 The provision of anesthesia services is an optional hospital service. However, if a hospital provides any degree of anesthesia service to its patients, the hospital must comply with all the requirements of this Condition of Participation (CoP). \u201cAnesthesia\u201d involves the administration of a medication to produce a blunting or loss of: \u2022 pain perception (analgesia); \u2022 voluntary and involuntary movements; \u2022 autonomic function; and \u2022 memory and/or consciousness, depending on where along the central neuraxial (brain and spinal cord) the medication is delivered. In contrast, \u201canalgesia\u201d involves the use of a medication to provide relief of pain through the blocking of pain receptors in the peripheral and/or central nervous system. The patient does not lose consciousness, but does not perceive pain to the extent that may otherwise prevail. The additional definitions below illustrate differences among the various types of anesthesia services. Not all of the definitions are considered \u201canesthesia.\u201d The definitions are generally based on American Society of Anesthesiologists definitions found in its most recent set of practice guidelines (Anesthesiology 2002; 96:1004-17).

      "text_content": "Patient\u2019s Instructions Hysterectomy Post-Operative Instructions General (cid:31) If you are having a Laparoscopic Hysterectomy or Vaginal Hysterectomy you can expect to go home later in the day of surgery or spend one night in the hospital. Your doctor will routinely see you the morning after surgery within 24 hours of your procedure and you will be \"discharged\" to leave sometime that day. (cid:31) If you are having an Abdominal Hysterectomy you can expect to spend 2 nights in the hospital. (cid:31) Both of these projected hospital stays are dependent on your ability to urinate, have some bowel function (Tolerate Some Food), and obtain relief with oral pain medicine. (cid:31) The night of surgery you will be gotten out of bed, but will have an I.V. line for fluid replacement and pain medicine, and possibly a catheter in your bladder. The next day the I.V and catheter will be removed, and you will be ambulating, getting out of bed to the bathroom, and showering. Driving (cid:31) We suggest that you do not plan on driving until you can control your vehicle and especially while taking narcotic pain relievers. Activity (cid:31) At home we encourage you to \"take what your body will give you\". You may go up and down stairs (a rough guideline is to limit your \"round-trips\" to 2 a day for the first week), take a tub bath or shower, and do what's necessary to take care of yourself (though nobody else) for the first week or so. Gradually increase your activity daily, especially walking. Our guideline is to wait 3 weeks following surgery before \"strenuous\" activity, meaning straining that will cause your face to flush for an extended time. Pain (cid:31) You will be prescribed oral pain medicine, usually a narcotic/acetaminophen (Tylenol) combination. Additionally you may take Ibuprofen over-the-counter 3-4 tablets 3-4 times daily. This can reduce the amount of narcotic pain medicine you need to take. Each (910) 295-0290 Hysterectomy Post-op 7070.03.15003.01 Sunset Date: 10/2019 Patient\u2019s Instructions prescription tablet will contain 325 or 500 mg of acetaminophen, and that number will be on the prescription label. You can also take acetaminophen alone. If you have pain unrelieved by these measures call the office. Nausea (cid:31) Occasionally people require medicine for nausea relief when they go home. If so, we will prescribe something. Incisions (cid:31) Most of the time your will have absorbable sutures under the skin which do not need to be removed. You may also have Dermabond, similar to \"super glue\" applied, which will gradually come off. Occasionally we use skin staples for wound closure, and these will need removal in approximately one week. Bowels (cid:31) Usually passing gas from below is a condition for discharge. After surgery it is extremely important that you do not get constipated. The single major thing that makes people feel well after surgery is resumption of bowel function. We encourage you to have adequate to extra fluid and fiber intake. Products such as Metamucil, Citrucel, Benefiber, etc. taken on a routine basis, 2-3 times a day until bowel movements become regular and normal, can help you recover more quickly. Surgery and narcotics both contribute to constipation. It is important, however, to take adequate pain relief since pain can also inhibit your ability to relax and have bowel movements more easily. Early discharge from the hospital also facilitates return to normal bowel function since most people more easily relax in the familiarity of their own home. Bladder (cid:31) You should be emptying your bladder normally when discharged. In the rare instances when you are discharged with a catheter we will instruct you on how and when to remove it. If unable to void, call the office. Bleeding (cid:31) You will probably have some slight bloody discharge that will gradually become white/yellow vaginal discharge, usually still be present at your Post-Op visit. Any bleeding should always be less than a \"normal\" menstrual period. You may have a \"gush\" of bloody (910) 295-0290 Hysterectomy Post-op 7070.03.15003.01 Sunset Date: 10/2019 Patient\u2019s Instructions discharge 2-3 weeks after surgery. If persistent or if you have questions please call the office. Questions (cid:31) Please call the advice nurse at 910-295-0213 for any questions or concerns. Call the FirstHealth operator at 910-715-1000 to call to reach the doctor on-call for after hours emergencies. Post-op appointment (cid:31) You will always be seen in 1 week and 4 weeks after surgery. You will often be made aware of this appointment date and time prior to your surgery, but we will also mail it to you. If for some reason you have not received this by one week following surgery, call the office 910-295-6831 to clarify. We may also ask to see you sooner than that and you will be told if we feel that is necessary. _____________________________________________________________________________________ ________________________________________________",

      "text_content": "MINIMALLY INVASIVE HYSTERECTOMY POSTOPERATIVE INSTRUCTIONS ACTIVITY \uf0b7 No heavy lifting/pushing/pulling for 6 weeks. Do not lift anything more than 10 lbs (such as laundry, groceries, children, pets), vacuum, push heavy doors or grocery carts, etc, for 6 weeks. \uf0b7 You may climb stairs as tolerated. \uf0b7 Do not put anything in the vagina for at least 6 weeks after surgery unless otherwise instructed by your doctor (including tampons, douching, sexual intercourse, etc). \uf0b7 No driving for 1 week after surgery and not while taking narcotic pain medication. Drive defensively when you are ready. \uf0b7 Avoid sitting or lying in bed for more than 2 hours at a time while you are awake to reduce your risk of blood clots. \uf0b7 You may return to work when you are ready as long as you do not lift more than 10 pounds for 6 weeks. If you have a sedentary job or work from home 1-2 weeks before returning to work is appropriate. You may return to work in 2-4 weeks if your job requires a lot of movement. Please contact your doctor if you need any return to work letters or medical leave paperwork to be completed. WOUND CARE \uf0b7 If you had a laparoscopic or robotic hysterectomy, you will have small incisions on your abdomen. There will be dissolvable stitches under your skin that do not need to be removed. If you have band aids or tegaderms on your incisions, these may be removed when you shower. If you have steri-strips (paper tape) on the incisions, these may be removed in about 1-2 weeks. It is OK to remove them if they are falling off. If skin glue is present, leave in place for at least 2 weeks. \uf0b7 Shower daily after surgery. Clean your incision with mild antibacterial soap and water. Pat your incision dry with a clean towel. No tub baths or swimming pools for six weeks or until wound is completely healed. \uf0b7 No ointments or antibacterial creams are required for incisions. Do NOT use cleansing agents like alcohol or hydrogen peroxide. \uf0b7 Wash your hands frequently, especially before touching your incision or changing any dressings. PAIN MANAGEMENT \uf0b7 Take your oral pain medication as needed. \uf0b7 Alternate Tylenol and ibuprofen/Motrin (if you are eligible). Each of these medications can be taken every six hours. Try to stagger them so that you are taking something for pain every three hours (ex. Take Motrin at 12:00, Tylenol at 3:00, Motrin at 6:00, etc.) to maximize pain relief. o Dosages \uf0a7 Tylenol \u2013 500-650 mg every 6 hours as needed \uf0a7 Motrin - 600 mg every 6 hours as needed o The maximum dose of Tylenol is 3000 mg in 24 hours, the maximum dose of Motrin/ibuprofen is 2400mg in 24 hours \uf0b7 Some pain medications can cause constipation. We recommend a stool softener (i.e. Colace) while you take these medications. \uf0b7 You may also take milk of magnesia or Miralax for constipation as directed on the bottle. \uf0b7 There is a risk for addiction with narcotic pain medication, so take with caution and do not take more than the recommended amount. The Cleveland Clinic Foundation \uf0b7 Please be sure to dispose of leftover pain medication after you have recovered. You may dispose of unused narcotic medications in the trash with an unpleasant substance such as coffee grounds or cat litter or you can turn them in to a designated law enforcement/pharmacy narcotic box. You can also check FDA.gov to assess which medications can be safely flushed down the toilet. \uf0b7 There are locations to dispose of unused medications at three Cleveland Clinic locations: Avon Hospital pharmacy, Hillcrest Hospital pharmacy, and the J Pharmacy at the Main Campus for Cleveland Clinic (inside the parking garage on the first floor). WHAT TO EXPECT AT HOME \uf0b7 Recovery from surgery is generally 2-4 weeks, but sometimes longer for more strenuous activity. It is normal to be very tired during this time. \uf0b7 It is normal to have some drainage or a small amount of vaginal bleeding after surgery that would require the use of a light pantiliner. This discharge may last up to 6 weeks. The bleeding and discharge should be light and should have no odor. \uf0b7 You may experience gas pain, abdominal swelling, or shoulder pain for 24-72 hours after surgery. This is from the carbon dioxide gas put into your abdomen to better visualize your organs. A warm shower, heating pad, and/or walking may help. WHEN TO CALL YOUR DOCTOR: \uf0b7 Fever (>100.4\u00b0F or 38.0\u00b0C) or chills. \uf0b7 Incision problems such as redness, warmth, swelling, or foul smelling drainage. \uf0b7 Severe nausea or persistent vomiting. \uf0b7 Bright red vaginal bleeding (soaking >1 pad/hour) or foul smelling vaginal drainage. o IT IS NORMAL TO HAVE A MINIMAL AMOUNT OF VAGINAL SPOTTING OR VAGINAL DISCHARGE FOR SEVERAL WEEKS \uf0b7 Severe pain not relieved with pain medication. \uf0b7 Pain and swelling in your legs, especially if it is only on one side. \uf0b7 Pain with urination, cloudy urine, or foul smelling urine. \uf0b7 Severe redness/irritation at sites where adhesive bandages were applied. \uf0b7 Or if you have any other problems or questions.

General Hospital Department of Gynecology Division of Gynecology Oncology Updated: 05/06/2024 VINCENT OBSTETRICS & GYNECOLOGY Introduction This pamphlet is part of the Mass General Brigham Healthcare System Gynecology Oncology Surgery ERAS (Enhanced Recovery After Surgery) program which is now the standard practice for all GYN scheduled open hysterectomy patients in the Partners Healthcare System and affiliated hospitals. W hat is the ERAS Program? This program is different from the traditional approach to surgery and has been shown to improve patient recovery after surgery along with reducing complications; reducing the number of days you stay in the hospital and reducing readmissions to the hospital after surgery. We want you, the patient, to also be an active participant in the recovery process. The overall goal is for you to have a better surgical experience and get back to normal as soon as possible. With your help, we can achieve these goals. This program is designed to keep you actively involved in your recovery prior to and after your surgery. This guide is divided into two stages: 1. Before Your Surgery 2. After Your Surgery Each stage of this program is tailored to minimize your pain, avoid complications, and allow for earlier resumption of food and activity. H ow long will I be in the hospital? If you are having a laparoscopic hysterectomy, you will almost always go home the day of your surgery. Even if you receive a letter from your insurance company approving a one-night stay, you will be discharged the same day. You will only stay in the hospital if there is a medical need (indication) to keep you in the hospital over-night. The goal is to be discharged as soon as possible, as increased length of stay in the hospital is linked to increased postoperative complications. 4 Developed by Mass.

      "text_content": "Center for Minimally Invasive Gynecologic Surgery Post operative instructions for laparoscopic hysterectomy Please read this carefully BEFORE your surgery. North Shore Medical Center\u2019s Minimally Invasive Gynecologic Surgery Program is committed to ensuring that your post-operative experience is as comfortable as possible. Please do not hesitate to call our office for any questions after your surgery. The following information will help answer frequently asked questions and will help you understand some of the common experiences that may occur after your surgery. Please note that most patients have very few complications after surgery. All patients should: A. Schedule a post operative appointment for two to four weeks after your surgery. B. Contact your gynecology surgeon if you experience any concerns or complications after surgery. Do NOT call your primary care physician. They do not know what specific surgery was performed, and will not be able to help you. C. If an Emergency Room visit is necessary after your stay, always return to NSMC where your surgery was performed. Returning to a local hospital may be convenient, but many smaller local facilities will not be able to adequately care for you, resulting in inadequate care. In addition, the physicians at North Shore Medical Center may not have privileges at these hospitals, and will not be able to take care of you should you require additional care. What to expect immediately after surgery: Activity There are no standard limitations with regard to activity after laparoscopic procedures except for driving and sexual activity (see below). In general, use common sense when deciding what activities you are willing to perform after surgery. Every patient is different, and different patients will have differing degrees of recovery. Gradually advance your activity. You should NOT be bedridden after these procedures. Continued movement and increased activity back to normal will prevent prolonged recovery times due to \u201cdetraining\u201d. Average Recovery Times About 90% of patients leave the hospital the same day, and 10% will stay overnight, usually due to nausea or pain. The average time back to work is 7-10 days for laparoscopy, and about two weeks for laparoscopic hysterectomy. You should be able to walk, eat and drink the day after the surgery with mild to moderate discomfort. Please note that every patient and procedure is different, and the times stated above can vary from patient to patient. Stairs You are allowed to use the stairs if you feel able. Lifting There are no restrictions for those patients with 5 or 10 mm incisions. For larger incisions, use caution immediately after surgery. Start with no more than 15 pounds. Exercise Gentle exercise is highly encouraged after surgery because it allows for faster return to normal function, and also helps with pain (exercise causes release of natural pain relieving compounds in your body). Use common sense when starting an exercise routine after surgery. Abdominal exercises You may resume these exercises when you feel comfortable. Cardio exercises Start out slowly and gradually increase time, distance and speed. If you are starting a new routine, consult your internal medicine physician if you have medical conditions affecting your heart or lungs. Driving Driving can begin only after you have stopped taking narcotics, and if you feel strong enough to be able to stop the vehicle in an emergency. Use common sense when you begin driving after your surgery \u2013 if you are not confident about your driving ability, have someone else drive for you. Sexual Function Sexual intercourse should not be engaged in for eight weeks after hysterectomy type procedures. After eight weeks, deep penetration should be avoided for the first several times to prevent injury to the vaginal cuff. After eight weeks, you should be cleared to resume pre-hysterectomy sexual activities. Bathing/Showering You may take a shower the day after surgery. Tub baths should be avoided until your incisions are healed. Bleeding Incisions NSMC physicians use surgical grade glue, or Demabond  on the incision sites. This protects the incision and will stay in place for up to two weeks or longer. The glue can be removed by using soap and water and gentle scrubbing with a washcloth in the shower or bath after two weeks. The glue contains an antibiotic which helps to prevent infection. Bleeding at the incision sites is not uncommon. This can be from the incision itself, or may be a light red-colored discharge from the adhesive barrier fluid. Please note that at NSMC an adhesion barrier fluid called Adept is often used to prevent the development of adhesions. To be effective, 500 to 750 cc of fluid (2 to 3 cups) is often left inside the prevent adhesion formation. This can leak out from the incisions, often appears to be light red, and is a normal process. If bleeding persists for more than two \u2013 three days or is heavy, please call the office.

Executive summary of recommendations Diagnosis and investigation What is the preferred classification for vault/pelvic organ prolapse? Standardised classification systems should be used for the assessment and documentation of D pelvic organ prolapse (POP), including vault prolapse. When is urodynamic testing required? Routine urodynamic assessment is not recommended in women with post-hysterectomy vaginal B vault prolapse (PHVP). [New 2015] In what setting should a patient with PHVP be assessed? Clinicians should work as part of a pelvic floor multidisciplinary team (MDT). [New 2015] P Are quality of life (QoL) measures of value? Patient assessment should address QoL issues using standardised tools. C Prevention What preventive techniques are of value at hysterectomy? McCall culdoplasty at the time of vaginal hysterectomy is effective in preventing subsequent PHVP. B Suturing the cardinal and uterosacral ligaments to the vaginal cuff at the time of hysterectomy is B effective in preventing PHVP following both abdominal and vaginal hysterectomies. Sacrospinous fixation (SSF) at the time of vaginal hysterectomy should be considered when the C vault descends to the introitus during closure. Does subtotal hysterectomy have a place in the prevention of PHVP? Subtotal hysterectomy is not recommended for the prevention of PHVP. [New 2015] A Are there preferred suture materials for vault support at the time of hysterectomy? There is inadequate and conflicting evidence over the use of permanent sutures in the short term C and no evidence of benefit in the long term; they can be associated with high suture exposure rates. [New 2015] Conservative management Is pelvic floor therapy of value in the management of PHVP? Pelvic floor muscle training (PFMT) is an effective treatment option for women with stage I\u2013II B vaginal prolapse, including PHVP. [New 2015] RCOG/BSUG Green-top Guideline No. 46 2 of 21  Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists What is the place of vaginal devices? Vaginal pessaries are an alternative treatment option for women with stage II\u2013IV PHVP. [New 2015] B Surgical management What are the indications for surgery? Surgical treatment should be offered to women with symptomatic PHVP after appropriate P counselling. [New 2015] Who should undertake surgery? PHVP surgery should be performed by an RCOG-accredited subspecialist urogynaecologist, or P gynaecologists who can demonstrate an equivalent level of training or experience. [New 2015] What is an acceptable successful result after surgical treatment? Patient-reported outcomes, including patient-reported success rates and relief of presenting C symptoms, should be the primary assessment outcomes. [New 2015] Objective cure is important as it correlates to symptoms of vaginal bulge; a Pelvic Organ Prolapse C Quantification (POP-Q) stage of I or O in the apical compartment seems to be acceptable and widely used as the optimum postoperative result. [New 2015] What surgical procedures are available for the treatment of PHVP? The type of operation performed should be tailored to the individual patient\u2019s circumstances. P A comparison of surgical procedures Open abdominal sacrocolpopexy (ASC) versus vaginal SSF Women should be aware that both ASC and SSF are effective treatments for primary PHVP. A ASC is associated with significantly lower rates of recurrent vault prolapse, dyspareunia and A postoperative stress urinary incontinence (SUI) when compared with SSF. However, this is not reflected in significantly lower reoperation rates or higher patient satisfaction. SSF is associated with earlier recovery compared with ASC. A SSF may not be appropriate in women with short vaginal length and should be carefully considered P in women with pre-existing dyspareunia. Laparoscopic and robotic sacrocolpopexy (LSC and RSC) LSC can be equally effective as ASC in selected women with primary PHVP. LSC can include mesh B extension or be combined with other vaginal procedures to correct other compartment prolapse. There is limited evidence on the effectiveness of RSC; therefore, it should only be performed in the C context of research or prospective audit following local governance procedures. [New 2015] High uterosacral ligament suspension (HUSLS) HUSLS should only be offered as first-line management in women with PHVP within the context of B research or prospective audit following local governance procedures. Clinicians should be aware of the risk of ureteric injury, especially in the laparoscopic approach.

You may also feel shoulder pain as a result of the CO that was used 2 to inflate the abdomen during the procedure. There will be a small amount of vaginal bleeding, though this should not be heavy. You may also feel tired as the anesthetic wears off, and may feel some pain in your throat from the breathing tube that was placed during the procedure. \u2022 You may be advised to engage in coughing, leg and breathing activities. These are important for your circulation. It is important for you to start walking shortly after your procedure. \u2022 Ensure that you rest when you are home from the hospital, though light walking at home does help to prevent blood clots. You can climb stairs, although it may be uncomfortable for the first few days after surgery. \u2022 Ask your physician for further timelines regarding initiation of other activities including driving after surgery.

      "text_content": "Post-Operative Hysterectomy Recovery Guidelines Professional hysterectomy recovery guidelines for safe exercises after a hysterectomy. This physiotherapy hysterectomy information is intended to promote safe return to exercise after hysterectomy. Contents: 1. How much walking after a hysterectomy 2. Posture exercises to promote recovery 3. Safe abdominal core exercises after hysterectomy 4. Pelvic floor exercises (kegel exercises) after hysterectomy 5. How exercise can promote hysterectomy recovery 6. Side effects of a hysterectomy and exercise Always seek approval from your medical specialist before commencing exercise after hysterectomy surgery. Contact your medical caregiver with any exercise-related concerns during hysterectomy recovery. 1. Walking guidelines - how much walking after a hysterectomy? During the first 6\u20138 weeks after a hysterectomy post-operative walking exercise aims to maintain general condition and minimize decrease in fitness during recovery. Walking tips: \uf0b7 Walk in the morning when well rested. \uf0b7 Wear support underwear for abdominal and pelvic support \uf0b7 Walk on flat surfaces, avoid hills \uf0b7 Wear well-cushioned footwear \uf0b7 Aim for a couple of short walks rather than one long walk when starting to build up endurance. Commence walking on flat surfaces and follow your gynecologists' instructions for how much walking you should be doing. Most women commence walking for 5 minutes in the first week, and increase by approximately 5 minutes every week after surgery however this will depends upon initial fitness levels and whether any complications occur post operatively. If you have discomfort associated with walking you have probably done too much. In this case reduce and/or slow down your walking program. 2. Posture and strength exercises after hysterectomy Good posture after a hysterectomy involves: \uf0b7 Standing tall \uf0b7 Gently activating deep abdominal core muscles (discussed next section) \uf0b7 Lifting the crown of the head towards the ceiling when sitting, standing and walking \uf0b7 Avoiding the tendency to bend forward to protect the abdomen with movement. Copyright  Pelvic Exercises.com.au Strength exercises after week 6. When you have your gynaecologists' approval, you may be ready to commence a strength training program using light weights. Inside Out - pelvic floor safe exercise program by Physiotherapist Michelle Kenway, teaches pelvic floor safe exercises. It also guides the reader through unsafe exercises and equipment that may injure the pelvic floor; these should be avoided after hysterectomy surgery. 3. Abdominal core exercises after surgical recovery The deep abdominal muscles should work with your pelvic floor muscles to protect and support your insides. Weak abdominal muscles do not support an abdominal wound and can contribute to discomfort with movement. If you can keep these muscles working well, they will also help you prevent and/or manage back pain and improve your posture. Appropriate exercises include gentle abdominal hysterectomy recovery exercises lying down with exercises such as heel slides or bent knee fall outs. Avoid sit up exercises after a hysterectomy - Sit ups increase downward pressure on the pelvic floor and the internal surgical site. 4. Kegel exercises (pelvic floor muscle exercises) after hysterectomy Pelvic floor muscles support the pelvic organs (bladder, vagina and rectum). The pelvic floor muscles will provide better support for hysterectomy wound repair if they are strong and functioning well. Try to maintain strong healthy pelvic floor muscles after a hysterectomy through regular Kegel exercises. Refer to kegel exercises after hysterectomy free video for guidelines. General opinion varies widely as to the best time to commence Kegel exercises after hysterectomy, so always check with your gynecologists' preferences before starting. Try to ensure that you understand how to perform pelvic floor exercises correctly to avoid risk of internal strain with the wrong technique. Exercise can promote hysterectomy recovery with improved: \uf0b7 ability to return to your everyday work and activities \uf0b7 confidence in moving \uf0b7 strength, energy and well being \uf0b7 posture and deep abdominal (core) muscle control \uf0b7 pelvic floor strength to support your surgery long-term. Exercise can address hysterectomy side effects These include: \uf0b7 Decreased fitness, strength and tone \uf0b7 Lung problems or blood clots in the deep veins in your calf muscles \uf0b7 Back pain and stiffness with prolonged bed rest and decreased movement \uf0b7 Decreased bladder control \uf0b7 Feelings of sadness, stress and anxiety.

      "text_content": "Department of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery P O S T O P E R A T I V E CARE INSTRUCTIONS FOLLOWING TONSILLECTOMY The following instructions will help you know what to expect in the days following surgery. Please call if you have any questions or concerns. Physical Activities: After surgery, your child should rest, but indoor quiet play after one or two days is fine. Strenuous physical activity following surgery is to be avoided for 2 weeks. Children may return to school whenever comfortable; a week is average; but 10 days is not unusual. Your child may resume PE and other sports after two weeks. Diet: The more your child drinks, the sooner the pain will subside. Water, apple juice, grape juice, and Gatorade are excellent sources of liquid. Soft foods such as popsicles,ice cream, sherbet, yogurt, pudding, apple sauce, and Jell-O should also be encouraged. Other soft, easily chewed foods are also excellent, such as soft noodles. Avoid hot or spicy foods or foods that are hard and crunchy. For children over age 5, chewing sugar free gum speeds help by reducing the muscle spasm after surgery and can be started anytime after surgery. Chewing gum should not be given to any child under the age of 5. Pain: For the first several days following surgery, pain in the throat is to be expected. This can usually be controlled with Liquid Tylenol (acetaminophen) or Tylenol with Codeine (prescription will be given at the time of surgery). We generally recommend that medications containing ibuprofen, motrin, ketoprofen be avoided for 2 weeks. Pain is often worse at night and may prompt the need for additional pain medication. Ear pain, especially with swallowing is common; this is not due to an ear infection, but due to referred pain from the surgery. Occasionally a stiff neck may also occur. Please call if it becomes excessively painful. See the back of this sheet for Tylenol (acetaminophen) and Tylenol with Codeine dosing for children. Ice Collar: An ice collar is helpful for post-operative sore throat. Make this by placing ice cubes and water in a large Zip-Lock bag and wrapping it in a towel. Gently lay the ice pack on the front of the neck. Gargling with ice water may also be helpful. Fever: A low-grade fever (less than 101.5 degrees) following surgery may occur and should be treated with Tylenol (acetaminophen) or Tylenol with codeine if pain is also present. While children have a fever, they should play quietly or remain in bed. If the fever persists (more than 2 days) or if a fever higher than 101.5 F develops, please call. Fever may indicate that you have not taken in sufficient fluids. Bleeding: Post-operative bleeding is unusual, but it can occur up to 2 weeks after surgery. If your child develops blood clots, fresh bleeding from the mouth or vomiting of blood, please bring your child to the nearest emergency room. Bleeding after tonsillectomy can be very serious and may require hospitalization. For severe bleeding, call 911. Please call our office or on-call ENT if your child goes to the ER or is hospitalized. The numbers are listed below. Follow-up: Within 3-4 weeks after surgery your child will be evaluated for healing. PLEASE CALL IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS! Office phone number 314-454-6162 / Monday - Friday 8:30 AM \u2013 4:30 PM. After regular hours, call 314-454-6000 and have the operator contact the ENT resident on call.

Fluid intake can be accomplished in a variety of ways including ice chips, popsicles, water, juices or gelatin. In general, avoid juices with citric acid, carbonated beverages, and dairy products. Ice cream and milk shakes often create thicker mucous that can be difficult to swallow. Soft solid foods may be added to the diet as tolerated. Avoid any hard food or foods with sharp corners. \u2022 Pain medicine will be prescribed for you. Take the pain medicine on a regular schedule to avoid peaks of pain. Avoid aspirin and ibuprofen, as these medications can increase your risk of postoperative bleeding. \u2022 Avoid strenuous activity and excessive talking for 10-14 days. \u2022 Ice packs laid over the front of the neck may be soothing. \u2022 If minor bleeding occurs, try ice chips and ice water gargles to stop the bleeding. \u2022 If bleeding persists or if bleeding is significant, medical evaluation will be needed. During working hours, call (925) 295-4100. Use option 2 to speak to the Head and Neck Surgery advice nurse. At night and on weekends, you will need to go the emergency room. \u2022 Call your physician if you develop a fever greater than 101 degrees F. Expectations: \u2022 Significant pain can be expected for 7 days in children undergoing tonsillectomy and for 12-14 days in adults undergoing tonsillectomy. \u2022 Some weight loss is expected. In adults, typical weight loss is 8 to 10 pounds. \u2022 Mild low-grade fevers are expected. \u2022 Often foul breath is noted after a few days and resolves within 14 days. \u2022 It is normal to see white or gray patches on the sides of the throat starting 1-3 days after the surgery. \u2022 In children, a voice change is often heard temporarily. \u2022 Full healing takes several weeks, but most patients are feeling much improved at 14 days. \u2022 You should have a follow up with your surgeon 2 weeks after surgery to assess your throat for adequate healing. This can be done by a phone call, email, or an in-person visit at the Head and Neck Surgery clinic. Please discuss with your surgeon regarding to your preference.

      "text_content": "Post Operative Instructions \u2013 SYDNEY CENTRE FOR EAR NOSE & THROAT Tonsillectomy (Adults) The general anaesthetic, surgery and medications may cause you to feel fatigued. Pain Over the first few post-operative days, your sore throat will worsen and can become very painful. Some patients also experience earache, due to referred pain. Sometimes, patients feel they are improving after a week, then start to have more pain again. It is very important to take the painkillers you\u2019ve been prescribed and contact your doctor if there are questions about pain and medication management, or you think you are experiencing significant side effects. Throat Tonsillectomy leaves two raw surfaces in the throat that will become coated and white. This is normal and will disappear by the fourth week. Bleeding A serious complication of tonsillectomy is bleeding from the tonsil wounds. This may occur up to two weeks after surgery. Patients with bleeding usually cough up or spit out bright red blood or clots. If you have any significant bleeding (brisk bleeding, lasting more than 1 minute) at any time, promptly attend your nearest public hospital Emergency Department. WHAT TO DO General Care You should rest at home for the first week and begin gentle walks in the second week, if you feel well. You will need two weeks off work and exercise, and you should not fly for 4 weeks. Fluids and oral intake It is very important that you drink plenty of fluids and stays well hydrated in the post-operative period. This will help reduce pain and discomfort. Most patients find cold and soft foods easier to swallow, but you may eat whatever you feel like. Avoid very hot, spicy or acidic foods to prevent discomfort. Patients who do not eat and drink well, can become dehydrated, then further intake is limited by increased discomfort so a negative cycle develops which culminates in unfavourable conditions in the region of the healing tonsillar fossae which can lead to infection or bleeding. Activity As much as possible try to avoid exercise, lifting anything heavy or overexertion. Contact with people with colds or flu should be avoided. Pain relief Your doctor will advise you about analgesia (pain-killers), which you will need to take regularly for the first week at least. Taking your medication half an hour before meals can make eating more comfortable. Paracetamol (Panadol, Panamax) should be taken regularly every 6 hours, up to the maximal daily dosage. Do not exceed the recommended daily dosage. In addition, Ibuprofen (Nurofen, Brufen) can be taken, as needed, every 6 hours, up to the maximal dosage. Do not exceed the recommended daily dosage. You may have received a prescription for Oxycodone, (Endone), which can be taken every 4-6 hourly, as required. It is especially useful before going to bed, but should be used throughout the day if Paracetamol and Ibuprofen have been taken and you are still finding it difficult to eat/drink. Other medications you may have received include Prednisone and Tapentadol (Palexia). It is important that you take these as directed, and do not exceed the recommended doses prescribed by your surgeon or anaesthetist. If you have questions about the dosage, please call your surgeon or GP. Codeine-containing medication (such as Panamax Co) should not be taken on the same day as Oxycodone. Codiene and Oxycodone may cause nausea, constipation or drowsiness. Ibuprofen may cause stomach upset. If a medication side effect is troubling you, seek advice from your surgeon or see your GP. If your pain relief is insufficient, contact your surgeon or see your GP. Post-operative appointment You will need to see your surgeon in the office about 4 weeks after surgery, unless otherwise arranged IMPORTANT INFORMATION Attend your nearest Emergency Department for serious complications e.g bleeding or prolonged vomiting or drowsiness.",

      "text_content": "www.nature.com/scientificreports OPEN Effect of monopolar diathermy power settings on postoperative pain, wound healing, and tissue damage after tonsillectomy: a randomized clinical trial Ju Hyun Yun 1,3, Jeon Yeob Jang 1,3, Yoo Seob Shin 1, Hyun Jun Kim 1,2, Chul\u2011Ho Kim 1 & Do\u2011Yang Park 1,2* This study aimed to assess the impact of varying monopolar diathermy power settings on postoperative pain, hemorrhage, and wound healing following tonsillectomy. A single\u2011center, prospective, randomized, double\u2011blinded, controlled clinical study was conducted. During bilateral tonsillectomy procedures, one tonsil received low\u2011power settings (15 W, cutting/blend) while the other tonsil received high\u2011power settings (35 W, cutting/blend). Postoperative pain scores (0\u201310) and wound healing scores (0\u20133) were evaluated immediately after surgery and at 1, 2, and 4 weeks postoperatively using the visual analog scale. Additionally, histological analysis was performed on electrically resected tonsil tissues to assess tissue damage in the tonsil bed. The allocation of high and low power settings to each side was randomized. Results showed that 1 week after the surgery, the high\u2011power group experienced significantly higher pain scores (mean \u00b1 standard deviation: 4.84 \u00b1 2.21) compared to the low\u2011power group (3.56 \u00b1 2.24, p = 0.049). Moreover, the high\u2011power side exhibited slower wound healing during the initial 1\u20132 weeks postoperatively, as indicated by lower wound scores at 2 weeks (high\u2011power: 1.96 \u00b1 0.64; low\u2011power: 2.43 \u00b1 0.59, p = 0.008). Furthermore, histological analysis revealed significantly deeper tissue degradation on the high\u2011power side compared to the low\u2011power side (p < 0.001), with mean depths of 565.2 \u00b1 291.0 \u00b5m and 156.0 \u00b1 36.8 \u00b5m, respectively. In conclusion, these findings suggest that when employing monopolar diathermy in tonsillectomy, lower power settings can lead to improved outcomes in terms of postoperative pain, wound healing, and tissue damage. Trial registration: CRIS identifier: KCT0005670 (cris.nih.go.kr, registration date: 11/12/2020). Tonsillectomy is a multi-frequency surgery with indications for various causes and diseases, such as frequent tonsillitis, obstructive sleep apnea, deep neck infection, and oropharyngeal abscess1\u20133. Since the conception of tonsillectomy, resection and hemostasis of the tonsils have utilized a variety of methods, from tools such as thread, surgical steel knives, and traditional compression dressing to various suture techniques. Early tonsillec- tomy was time-consuming and associated with a relatively large amount of perioperative bleeding and delayed wound r ecovery4. From the mid-1900s to the present day, electrical surgical units (ESUs) capable of relatively rapid surgery and hemostasis, such as electric monopolar cautery4,5, c oblation6, and plasmablade7, have been applied in tonsillectomy. These innovations aim to reduce operation time, minimize complications, decrease intraoperative and postoperative bleeding, alleviate postoperative pain, and shorten the recovery period8. The most commonly used ESU device is a monopolar electro-surgery instrument9\u201311. There have been various studies and guidelines for tonsillectomy, mainly in terms of postoperative major and minor bleeding and reoperation. Representatively, in 2004, Lowe et al. observed that when monopolar dia- thermy was applied, it showed a statistically significant increase in postoperative bleeding and reoperation rates 1Department of Otolaryngology, Ajou University School of Medicine, 164 Worldcup-ro, Yeongtong-gu, Suwon 16499, Republic of Korea. 2Sleep Center, Ajou University Hospital, Suwon, Republic of Korea. 3These authors contributed equally: Ju Hyun Yun and Jeon Yeob Jang. *email: entdyp@ajou.ac.kr Scientific Reports | (2024) 14:267 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-023-50633-z 1 Vol.:(0123456789) www.nature.com/scientificreports/ compared to cold steel knife and the NICE guideline published in 2005 reported that it was better to avoid tonsil surgery using monopolar diathermy12,13. However, there have been differences of opinion on the study d esign14, and there have also been various opposing studies on the results15,16. Even after that, monopolar diathermy for tonsillectomy is the most frequently applied method4,11,16\u201318. It may be caused by differences in the medical envi- ronment between countries, shorter surgery time and convenience of surgery, which can be related to the rate of complications in patients. In addition, since most studies focused on bleeding and reoperation, few studies reported on patient discomfort, pain, or wound recovery. According to the results of tonsillectomy studies performed with various instruments with various amounts of energy, it is thought that high bleeding and reoperation tendencies are mainly observed when devices with high energy are used2,19\u201321.

What is Coronary Artery Bypass Surgery? Coronary artery bypass \u2014 also known as coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG, pronounced \u201ccabbage\u201d) \u2014 is a surgical procedure that improves the blood flow to the heart muscle if your coronary arteries are blocked or damaged. A surgeon uses blood vessels from another area of the body (usually your arm or leg) to repair the damaged arteries so that the heart can function properly. Depending on your condition, you may have multiple bypasses in one surgery.

Treatment decisions with regard to coronary revascularization in patients with coronary artery disease should be based on clinical indications, regardless of sex, race, or ethnicity, because there is no evidence that some patients benefit less than others, and efforts to reduce disparities of care are warranted. 5 Top 10 Take Home Messages 2. In patients being considered for coronary revascularization for whom the optimal treatment strategy is unclear, a multidisciplinary Heart Team approach is recommended. Treatment decisions should be patient centered, incorporate patient preferences and goals, and include shared decision- making. 6 Top 10 Take Home Messages 3. For patients with significant left main disease, surgical revascularization is indicated to improve survival relative to that likely to be achieved with medical therapy. Percutaneous revascularization is a reasonable option to improve survival, compared with medical therapy, in selected patients with low to medium anatomic complexity of coronary artery disease and left main disease that is equally suitable for surgical or percutaneous revascularization. 7 Top 10 Take Home Messages 4. Updated evidence from contemporary trials supplement older evidence with regard to mortality benefit of revascularization in patients with stable ischemic heart disease, normal left ventricular ejection fraction, and triple-vessel coronary artery disease. Surgical revascularization may be reasonable to improve survival. A survival benefit with percutaneous revascularization is uncertain. Revascularization decisions are based on consideration of disease complexity, technical feasibility of treatment, and a Heart Team discussion. 8 Top 10 Take Home Messages 5. The use of a radial artery as a surgical revascularization conduit is preferred to the use of a saphenous vein conduit to bypass the second most important target vessel with significant stenosis after the left anterior descending coronary artery. Benefits include superior patency, reduced adverse cardiac events, and improved survival. 9 Top 10 Take Home Messages 6. Radial artery access is recommended in patients undergoing percutaneous intervention who have acute coronary syndromes or stable ischemic heart disease, to reduce bleeding and vascular complications compared with a femoral approach. Patients with acute coronary syndromes also benefit from a reduction in mortality rate with this approach. 10 Top 10 Take Home Messages 7. A short duration of dual antiplatelet therapy after percutaneous revascularization in patients with stable ischemic heart disease is reasonable to reduce the risk of bleeding events. After consideration of recurrent ischemia and bleeding risks, select patients may safely transition to P2Y12 inhibitor monotherapy and stop aspirin after 1 to 3 months of dual antiplatelet therapy. 11 Top 10 Take Home Messages 8.

      "text_content": "Thyroidectomy/ Parathyroidectomy Post-Operative Instructions What should I expect after my surgery? \uf0b7 Your recovery will depend on why you had surgery, the type of surgery performed, and your previous activity level. \uf0b7 Neck incisions heal rapidly. You may shower and wash gently with soap and water over the incision 24 hours after surgery. \uf0b7 You will see swelling or bruising develop in the area around the incision 1-3 days after surgery. You may also notice swelling, firmness, a pulling sensation, or even some trouble swallowing. This often increases over the first 1-2 weeks and then begins to resolve over 6-8 weeks. These are normal sensations. \uf0b7 Your scar will be most visible for the first 1-2 months after surgery, improve significantly over 2-3 months, and gradually fade over the next 6-9 months. \uf0b7 UV rays from sunlight can make your scar darker than normal. Plan to use use sunblock (SPF over 30) over your incision daily for at least one year. \uf0b7 Allow one full year for your incision site and scar to take its final form, color, and consistency. The scars are often barely noticeable, but everyone heals their scars in their own way. If you are concerned about the appearance of your scar after a year, there are options for treatment. Will my neck hurt? \uf0b7 You may apply a cold pack over your incision to relieve any pain and help minimize swelling. This is most beneficial in the first 24 hours after surgery. \uf0b7 Most patients have mild pain from the incision and may complain more about a sore throat from the breathing tube. You may have stiffness or soreness in your shoulders, back, or neck. You may also have tension headaches which may last a few days before they go away. o You can treat these common symptoms with anti-inflammatory medications, warm compresses, and light massage. Endocrine Surgery 734-936-5738 - 1 - o You may also use a heating pad on the affected areas for 15-20 minutes at a time several times a day. Do not sleep on the heating pad or leave the heating pad directly on the skin for extended periods of time to prevent accidental injury or burns. \uf0b7 For a sore throat, try liquids, throat lozenges, or throat sprays for relief. Pain medication is often not particularly helpful for pain inside the throat when swallowing. \uf0b7 The skin just above and below your incision will feel numb. This will usually improve over several months, although this can be permanent in some patients. \uf0b7 Do not be afraid to move your neck. You may move your head in all four directions. Be careful about looking upward to any great extent so the edges of the incision do not separate. Will my voice be affected? Your voice may be slightly hoarse or weak after surgery. This is normal and does not mean there was damage to the nerves that make the vocal cords move. The breathing tube used during surgery often irritates the vocal cords. Your voice will usually return to normal within 6-8 weeks after surgery and often after only several days. Can I resume my previous medications? \uf0b7 Please read your discharge summary for the latest and most up to date list of medications you should take. \uf0b7 Before discharge, be sure to review your medications with your doctor or inpatient medical team if you have any questions about what medications you should or should not take. What new medications might I need to take? \uf0b7 Thyroid Hormone: If you had thyroid surgery, you may be prescribed a type of thyroid hormone replacement called levothyroxine (Synthroid, Levothroid, Levoxyl, etc.). Take your thyroid hormone medication on an empty stomach and by itself. Avoid taking calcium or any other medication within an hour of taking your thyroid hormone pill. You will have a blood test in 6-8 weeks to ensure the amount prescribed is correct. If you have thyroid cancer and will Endocrine Surgery Thyroidectomy/ Parathyroidectomy Post-Operative Instructions - 2 - need to have a radioactive iodine scan, you will likely be placed on liothyronine (Cytomel) instead of levothyroxine. After your radioactive iodine scan, you will be placed on levothyroxine. \uf0b7 Calcium Supplement: Your body\u2019s calcium level may decrease after undergoing total thyroidectomy, completion thyroidectomy, or parathyroidectomy. If you only had part of your thyroid gland removed most patients do not require calcium supplementation, but follow your surgeon\u2019s instructions regarding this. We recommend you purchase Citracal Maximum Plus with Vitamin D3 (pictured below). This is available at most pharmacies and grocery stores as an over-the- counter medication. You do not need a prescription for this. The cost is approximately $10-$15 per bottle. Citracal Maximum (calcium citrate 650mg with 1000 IU Vitamin D3): 2 tablets of calcium are equal to one \u201cserving\u201d. Each tablet has 325 mg calcium per tablet and 500 IU of Vitamin D3. Taking 2 tablets provides 650mg of calcium and 1000 IU of Vitamin D. The standard dose following surgery is 2 tabs three times daily; however, the overall dose and the number of time",

Gamble, MD POST-OPERATIVE INSTRUCTIONS THYROIDECTOMY/PARATHYROIDECTOMY Recovery: Recovery from anesthesia usually occurs over several hours. Following the surgery, the patient is transported to the recovery room where they are observed for approximately an hour. They are then transferred to the postoperative medical ward, where they are usually kept overnight. During the remainder of the first day, the patient is typically groggy and tired, but progressively improves. The patient is typically discharged the following day. We usually ask patients to budget from 3-5 days off of work and activities during the first week. Diet: The patient is typically given clear liquids either in recovery, or upon transfer to the floor. Depending on the level of grogginess, throat discomfort, and whether they have nausea, the patient\u2019s diet is advanced to a regular diet rapidly over the first and second day. Upon return home, there are no dietary restrictions. Activity: We typically have the patient maintain head elevation while in bed during the first week. This reduces swelling and discomfort. We suggest no heavy lifting or vigorous activity during the first week. We would request that the patient not travel out of the DFW area during the first week. Instructions/expectations: pain: The pain following thyroidectomy is typically surprisingly mild. Most patients have good pain control with Tylenol, or a mild oral narcotic pain medication for the first few days after surgery. We do ask the patient to avoid NSAID\u2019s like Motrin, ibuprofen, Advil, Aspirin, or Aleve. It is common to have some mild throat pain for a day or two after this surgery due to the proximity of the surgical site to the throat, and the breathing tube, which is in place during the surgery. nausea: Nausea is occasionally present after a general anesthesia. If present in the hospital, the nursing staff can administer anti-nausea medications. If present after discharge, anti-nausea medications can be called in by your surgeon or their office staff. fever: Fever is not expected after thyroid surgery. If a fever over 100 is present, please call the physician. swelling: Typically, the lower neck does mildly swell during the first 24-48 hours, then the swelling slowly subsides over a period of 1-2 weeks. Some firmness of the region above the incision is common for several months after surgery. numbness: Most patients have numbness of the region around the incision for a period of weeks \u2013 to-months. tingling: If the patient had a total thyroidectomy, we ask the patient to watch for tingling in the fingers/hands, the toes/feet, or around the lips. If any of this occurs, we would ask that the patient call the surgeon for further instructions hoarseness: Hoarseness is not uncommon after thyroid surgery, and is usually temporary. It is most commonly caused by the breathing tube which is in place during the surgery, manipulation of the nerve to the voice box or both. If present, this typically lasts days. If there was an injury to the nerve, the voice could be weak for a longer period of time. If you have hoarseness after surgery, your surgeon will discuss the outlook and timing of recovery based on the findings during the surgery. drains: The patient usually has a surgical drain placed in the region where the thyroid used to be. This thin tube extends out of the skin and empties into a collection apparatus. The surgeon typically removes the drain the am after surgery. In some cases, the output is too much to remove the drain, in which case the patient can be sent home with the drain in place. The nursing staff at the hospital will instruct the patient how to care for the drain. incision care: The surgical incision is typically closed with absorbable sutures under the skin, steri-strips (tape affixed to the skin), or sutures on the skin. Your surgeon will update you on which method of closure was used, and how the incision is to be cared for. Medications: Pain medication(s) as per your surgeon\u2019s instructions. Commonly used medications include acetaminophen or prescription acetaminophen/hydrocodone. Antibiotic if prescribed by your surgeon. If you underwent a total thyroidectomy, thyroid replacement hormones will be prescribed. Follow-up appointment: A routine follow-up visit is usually made for about one week after surgery. The office staff makes this appointment when the patient calls to set up surgery.",

      "text_content": "Thyroid surgery: your recovery journey Information for patients You are going to have surgery to remove part of or all of your thyroid and we want to ensure you recover from your operation as quickly and as well as possible. This booklet explains what happens after your operation and what you can do to help your recovery. Everyone gets over surgery in different ways so not all of the advice in this booklet will be suitable for you. If you have any questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to speak to any member of the team caring for you. They will help you to make the right decisions for a safe and fast recovery. Confirming your identity Before you have a treatment or procedure, our staff will ask you your name and date of birth and check your ID band. If you don\u2019t have an ID band we will also ask you to confirm your address. If we don\u2019t ask these questions, then please ask us to check. Ensuring your safety is our primary concern. www.kch.nhs.uk Contents Diet and swallowing 3 Medication 4 Caring for your wound and scar 5 Neck and shoulders exercise 7 Activity 10 Going back to work 11 Driving 11 Smoking 11 Your recovery journey 12 Who can I contact with queries and concerns? 14 More information 15 2 Diet and swallowing Following your surgery, you will be cared for on a post-surgical ward. The ward nursing staff will let you know when you can start eating and drinking again. This may be as early as an hour after surgery, depending on how quickly you get back your ability to swallow after the anaesthetic used during your operation begins to wear off. \u2022 You may find it hard to swallow at first, so start by drinking liquids and then eating soft foods such as pudding, yogurt, scrambled eggs and mashed potatoes. Avoid eating hard or scratchy foods such as crisps or raw crunchy vegetables. You can also take pain relief. \u2022 You can eat whatever you like after surgery, though we would advise you have a healthy balanced diet to help ensure you have all the nutrients you need for healing. \u2022 Your bowel movements might not be regular immediately after your surgery and you may have some constipation. This is common. You can ease constipation by eating high-fibre foods and drinking plenty of fluids to help make your stools softer. If you remain constipated, ask your pharmacist or GP for a laxative. 3 Medication Total thyroidectomy (whole of your thyroid removed) \u2022 Levothyroxine: If you have your whole thyroid removed, we will give you at least two weeks supply of a thyroid hormone replacement medicine called levothyroxine when you are discharged home. You will need to keep taking this medication for the rest of your life. \u27a2 Take levothyroxine on an empty stomach and at least 30 minutes before breakfast. \u27a2 Do not take levothyroxine together with calcium and zinc \u2013 wait for at least four hours before taking these supplements. \u27a2 Please contact your GP for a repeat prescription one week after discharge. \u2022 Calcium and vitamin D: We may give you a short course of calcium and vitamin D supplements when you go home, usually one to two weeks supply. This is to prevent the symptoms of low calcium developing after surgery, allowing your parathyroid glands time to recover so that your calcium level is maintained naturally. You do not need to keep taking these supplements once you have used all the tablets we have given you unless you have been instructed to do so by the surgical team or you develop symptoms of low calcium level, including: \u27a2 Tingling or numbness in your fingertips, toes and lips \u27a2 Twitching facial muscles \u27a2 Muscle pains or cramps, particularly in your legs and feet \u27a2 Mood changes, such as feeling irritable, anxious or depressed \u27a2 Dry, rough skin \u27a2 Fingernails that break easily or coarse hair that may fall out Please contact your surgeon, CNS (see page 14) or call 111 if these symptoms develop. 4 Hemithyroidectomy (part of your thyroid removed) If you have part of your thyroid removed you may not require any new medication when you are discharged home. Caring for your wound and scar Wound care \u2022 Your wound will be covered with special skin glue. \u2022 You can shower with soap the day after surgery. Pat the area dry \u2013 do not rub. The glue will start to dissolve and will come away slowly over a two week period. \u2022 Do not bathe or swim or do any other activity where your wound is put completely under water for at least two weeks or until your surgeon says it is safe to do so. Signs of healing \u2022 Swelling \u2013 up to six days: The area around your wound might look a little red and swollen and feel warm for up to six days after your operation. This is because fresh blood is bringing more oxygen and nutrients to your wound. You might see clear fluid in or around your wound and this means white blood cells are working on defending and rebuilding. \u2022 Rebuilding \u2013 up to a month: You might notice a fresh, raised, red scar forming over the wound for up to a month after surgery. It is also normal to see some new red bumps inside your shr",

Ramos, M.D. Thyroidectomy Postoperative Instructions Diet: You may have liquids by mouth once you have awakened from anesthesia. If you tolerate the liquids without significant nausea or vomiting then you may take solid foods without restrictions. Generally, patients experience a mild sore throat for 2-3 days following head and neck surgery. This usually does not interfere with swallowing. Pain Control: Patients report mild to moderate neck pain for several days following most neck surgeries. This is usually well controlled with prescription strength oral pain medications. You should avoid non- steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS) such as aspirin, ibuprofen, naproxen (Excedrin, Motrin, Naprosyn, Advil) because these drugs are mild blood thinners and will increase your chances of having a post-operative bleed into the neck tissues or neck wound. To relieve pain you may take either regular Tylenol 325mg two tablets every 3-4 hours or Tylenol #3 as prescribed. Calcium supplement: If you had a total thyroidectomy (removal of both sides of the thyroid), take the following: 1) Tums Ultra strength 1000, 2 tablets 4 times a day for 7 days. This acts as a calcium supplement. 2) Rocaltrol (calcitrol) 0.5 micrograms, 2 pill a day, for 7days. You will be given a prescription for this. If you experience numbness or tingling in your fingers, hands, or toes, this means that your calcium level is probably a little low. Call the office if this should occur and you will be instructed to increase both your calcium intake and the calcitrol. If you only had a thyroid lobectomy (removal of one side), there is no need to take additional calcium. Activity: Sleep with the head elevated for the first 48 hours. You may use an extra pillow to keep the head slightly flexed. No heavy lifting or exercise for 3 weeks following the surgery. You should plan for a minimum of 1 week away from work. If your job requires manual labor, lifting or straining then you should be out of work for a minimum of 2 weeks. Wound Care: The neck will likely have special adhesive tape stickers that your surgeon will remove during your post-operative visit. Mild redness and swelling around the wound is normal and will decrease over time following surgery. You may shower with your back facing the shower head, but try not to allow the wound to get wet 48 hours following the surgery. Do not scrub or manipulate the wound for 7 days. Do not soak the wound in a bath tub. Pat dry, don\u2019t rub it with a towel. Follow-up Appointment: Your follow-up appointment in the office will be approximately 1 week following your surgery. This visit should be scheduled prior to your surgery (at the time of your pre-operative visit). If you do not have the appointment made, please contact our office when you arrive home. At the post-operative visit, your steri-strips and sutures are removed and the pathology report is reviewed with you.

      "text_content": "GIRFT, RCS and BAETS Best practice for Thyroidectomy Documentation September 2022 GIRFT is part of an aligned set of programmes within NHS England Contents 1. Background and Justification 2 2. Standards for documentation of practice in all patients undergoing thyroidectomy: 3 3. Duty of Candour 5 4. Case Vignettes 5 5. Acknowledgements and References 8 1. Background and Justification This guidance has been produced by GIRFT in partnership with the Royal College of Surgeons (RCS) and British Association of Endocrine & Thyroid Surgeons (BAETS). It is aimed to provide advice on various aspects of surgery which should be available and clearly documented in a thyroidectomy operation record. The document is not a comprehensive guide to this surgical procedure, however it is hoped that surgeons will find the advice it offers helpful. This document was developed from the analysis of existing guidance, medical negligence claims notified to NHS Resolution by NHS trusts, feedback from NHS panel firm lawyers and expert witnesses. It has been established that poor operative documentation has made the investigation of incidents leading to claims difficult and has prevented the defence of good clinical practice. This guidance seeks to provide (non-mandatory) recommendations of what would reasonably be expected to be documented to support both good clinical communication with colleagues and potential review of operations in response to a patient complaint. It is expected that the standards listed would be included within the documentation of patient care and although the majority will be included in the operation note, the information could be contained elsewhere in the patient record including assessment in A&E, ward round entries, a separate WHO Surgical Safety Checklist and drug charts. It is preferable where possible that the operation record is typed. The documentation where appropriate may be made by other members of the surgical team apart from the operating surgeon. However, it is the operating surgeon\u2019s responsibility to ensure that appropriate documentation has occurred. The operating record should accompany the patient into recovery and to the ward. The guidance includes case vignettes which provide useful context and should be read in parallel with the recommendations. 2. Recommendations for documentation of practice in all patients undergoing thyroidectomy: 1. The indications for the operation and the evidence both in terms of serological markers, imaging, presenting complaint and clinical examination that has led to the recommendation to perform this operation. If appropriate, record the outcomes of any MDT meetings used to discuss complex cases including the agreed actions. 2. Documentation of the informed consent process including the risks of not operating should be available. The likelihood of a blood transfusion or the need to proceed with any other additional procedures as relevant should be recorded along with the associated risks. It should be clearly documented if the patient does not consent to any of these relevant procedures including transfusion. 3. Safety briefing, sign in, time out, and sign out as part of WHO Surgical Safety Checklist1. Presence of required surgical equipment should be confirmed2. 4. Record names of all surgeons including name/grade of lead surgeon and assistants. 5. Record the date and time of the procedure. 6. Record names and grade of anaesthetist(s) and type(s) of anaesthetic used. 7. If used, record the use of an intraoperative nerve monitoring and whether it is intermittent or continuous. Any additional monitoring beyond recurrent laryngeal nerve monitoring and whether the nerve was stimulated at 1mA/designated current post-procedure e.g., for operations including neck dissection this should be highlighted. 8. Record drugs given pre-operatively and during surgery including the local anaesthetic (+/- adrenaline) drug name, volume and concentrations. 9. Record patient position and skin preparation. 10. Describe or draw the location of the incisions made with reference to anatomical landmarks and previous surgical wounds. 11. Record keys steps of the approach including whether and on which side the strap muscles were divided for access. 12. Documentation of identification and protection of key structures including superior and inferior parathyroids, recurrent laryngeal nerve and external superior laryngeal nerve. Document if additional technology is used to aid parathyroid identification: Fluoptics +/- indocyanine green to assess gland viability. It must be documented if parathyroid transplantation takes place, which gland and at which site did transplantation take place. A suggested table is illustrated below: 3 Left Right Structure Identified? Preserved? Stimulating at Identified? Preserved? Stimulating end of end of procedure? procedure?

You have also been given prescriptions to help with pain and swelling. \u2022 Ice the area for the first 4-\u00ad\u20106 hours after surgery to reduce pain, swelling and bleeding. We recommend either a bag of frozen peas or an individual wrapped and frozen hot dog. DO NOT insert the hot dog; just lay it on the anal area. \u2022 Toradol (Ketorolac) 15mg #12. Take one pill every 6 hours until they are gone. These pills are for pain and swelling, you should take them even if you don\u2019t have pain to help with the swelling. If you have diabetes, kidney disease, or are taking Lisinopril or are allergic to non-\u00ad\u2010steroidal anti-\u00ad\u2010 inflammatories (NSAIDS) you will not be given this medication. \u2022 Percocet (Oxycodone/Acetaminophen) 5/500mg #28. Take 1-\u00ad\u20102 tablets every 4-\u00ad\u20106 as needed. DO NOT wait until the pain is severe before taking this medication. Take this medication with food to avoid nausea. Do not drink alcoholic beverages or drive while taking this medication. Because narcotics can cause constipation you should only use this medication if you have pain that is not relieved with Toradol, ice, and baths. If you have a pain doctor they will need to provide you the narcotic or if you are allergic to narcotics you will not be given this medication. \u2022 Lidocaine-\u00ad\u2010Prilocaine 2.5%-\u00ad\u20102.5% topical cream. Use if the pain is severe and not well controlled with the other medications. Apply around the anus or near the incision up to 4 times a day. o Dressing/Wound Care: \u2022 Keep the dressing that was placed on the wound in surgery on for the first 4 to 6 hours while you ice the area (see instructions above on ice). After this you may remove the dressing. \u2022 Do not keep removing the dressing if bloody as this just removes the clot and prevents the area from stopping the bleeding and drainage which can last up to 3 months after the procedure. \u2022 Use a mini pad, light day pad, or gauze on the area to keep it dry. \u2022 Keep the area of the surgery completely dry. Moisture and wetness will slow your recovery. If you don\u2019t have to stool don\u2019t force yourself to stool. Ideally avoid stooling the day of your surgery. 1 p: 602-\u00ad253-\u00ad4271 I f: 602-\u00ad253-\u00ad4273 6245 N 16th Street\u2022 Phoenix AZ 85016 I 20325 N 51st Ave Ste 102 \u2022Glendale AZ 85308 www.azcolorectal.com McConnell COLORECTAL CENTER seamless innovation for your wellbeing \u2022 If you need to stool you must remove the dressing. To clean after stooling you may wash the area with a shower head, as this is the best way to clean. If you are having pain after stooling or pain that will not go away despite the pain medication try local dry heat and ice alternately. \u2022 Only as a last resort for pain: Once the dressing or pad remains dry or only has a few spots of blood you may begin to take a 5 to 10 minute warm bath or sitz bath every 4 hours during the first 24 to 48 hours after surgery. This will help decrease the pain. Keep the baths short; soaking for more than 10 minutes can increase the chance of infection. If you have little or no pain do the warm baths only after stooling to keep the area clean. Remember moisture and wetness slow your recovery. \u2022 Keep the anus clean and dry, you may use a warm flow hair dryer for total drying. o Elimination: \u2022 It is important that you urinate (stooling is not a requirement) the evening of the day of surgery. DO NOT wait until your bladder feels uncomfortably full. If you cannot urinate normally, try to do so in the shower or bath tub. This will not hurt the wounds. DO NOT overhydrate yourself trying to urinate, drink only your usual amount of liquids. WHEN TO SEEK TREATMENT If you experience any of the symptoms below, call the doctor or nurse so we can determine if you will require additional treatment. If you are unable to reach either the doctor or nurse go to the nearest emergency room for evaluation. \u2022 If you have more than a cup of clotted blood from your rectum at any time \u2022 If you have not urinated within 6 hours of your procedure, even after trying the methods above. \u2022 If your pain is increasing and not responding to treatment. \u2022 If you are having fevers, chills or sweats. DAYS FOLLOWING SURGERY o Diet: \u2022 Eat a regular diet as tolerated. Remember to eat plenty of fiber (oatmeal, fresh fruits and vegetables). This will help give your stool bulk and prevent diarrhea. Diarrhea and thin stools can be as bad or worse than hard stool. \u2022 Drink plenty of water, at least 6 to 8 glasses a day (unless yo",

The goal of an ASC survey is to determine if the ASC is in compliance with the definition of an ASC, ASC general conditions and requirements, and the CfCs at 42 CFR 416 Subparts A through C. Certification of ASC compliance with the regulatory requirements is accomplished through observations, interviews, and document/record reviews. The survey process focuses on an ASC\u2019s delivery of patient care, including its organizational functions and processes for the provision of care. The ASC survey is the means used to assess compliance with Federal health, safety, and quality standards that will assure that patients receive safe, quality care, and services. Regulatory and Policy References \u2022 The Medicare definition of an ASC is found at 42 CFR 416.2 Subpart A. \u2022 General conditions and requirements for Medicare-participating ASCs are found at 42 CFR 416 Subpart B \u2022 The CfCs for ASCs are located at 42 CFR 416 Subpart C. \u2022 Survey authority and compliance regulations can be found at 42 CFR 416 Subpart B and at 42 CFR Part 488 Subpart A. \u2022 Should an individual or entity (ASC) refuse to allow immediate access upon reasonable request to either a State Agency (SA) or CMS surveyor, the Department of Health and Human Services Office of Inspector General (OIG) may exclude the ASC from participation in all Federal healthcare programs in accordance with 42 CFR 1001.1301. If a surveyor intends to make a request for immediate access with the threat of possible exclusion for non-compliance, the SA must first contact the CMS Location (formerly known as the Regional Office), which must then contact the OIG Administrative and Civil Remedies Branch at 202-619-1306. \u2022 The CMS State Operations Manual (SOM) provides CMS policy regarding survey and certification activities. All ASC surveys are unannounced. Do not provide the ASC with advance notice of the survey. Tasks in the Survey Protocol The tasks included in a survey protocol for an ASC are: Task 1 Off-Site Survey Preparation; Task 2 Entrance Activities; Task 3 Information Gathering/Investigation; Task 4 Preliminary Decision-Making and Analysis of Findings; Task 5 Exit Conference; and Task 6 Post-Survey Activities. Task 1 \u2013 Off-Site Preparation General Objectives The objectives of this task are to determine the size and composition of the survey team and to analyze information about the provider/supplier in order to identify areas of potential focus during the survey. Review of information about the ASC allows the SA (or CMS Location for Federal teams) to develop a preliminary survey plan. A full or standard survey will be conducted if the purpose of the survey is for initial certification, recertification, or validation of an accreditation organization survey. Surveys in response to a complaint or multiple complaints, or as a revisit to see if a previously cited problem has been corrected, will be focused on the CfCs related to the complaint or on the CfC for which deficiencies were previously identified. This does not preclude the scope of a complaint or revisit survey being expanded, if surveyors observe deficient practices related to other CfCs while on site. (See State Operat",

DO NOT use a rubber ring for sitting or resting; use a pillow or soft cushion instead. Increase activity and stop above restrictions as pain and discomfort diminish. Healing rates vary from patient to patient and are also dependent on the extent of the procedure. Return to work or full activity when able to do so without significant pain.

      "text_content": "Hemorrhoidectomy: Before Your Surgery What is a hemorrhoidectomy? Hemorrhoidectomy is surgery to remove hemorrhoids. These are swollen veins in the anal area. During this surgery, the doctor will cut out the swollen veins. After surgery, the pain and itching from your hemorrhoids should go away. After this surgery, you will probably go home the same day. You will have some pain in your anal area. You may also have light bleeding from your anus. These symptoms may last for 1 to 2 months. Your doctor will give you medicine to help relieve your pain. Your doctor may also give you stool softeners. These help make your bowel movements easier. Avoid heavy lifting for 4 weeks after surgery. You will probably need to take 1 to 2 weeks off from work. This depends on the type of work you do and how you feel. How do you prepare for surgery? Surgery can be stressful. This information will help you understand what you can expect. And it will help you safely prepare for surgery. Preparing for surgery \u2022 You may need to empty your colon with an enema or laxative. Your doctor will tell you how to do this. \u2022 Be sure you have someone to take you home. Anesthesia and pain medicine will make it unsafe for you to drive or get home on your own. \u2022 Understand exactly what surgery is planned, along with the risks, benefits, and other options. \u2022 If you take aspirin or some other blood thinner, ask your doctor if you should stop taking it before your surgery. Make sure that you understand exactly what your doctor wants you to do. These medicines increase the risk of bleeding. \u2022 Tell your doctor ALL the medicines and natural health products you take. Some may increase the risk of problems during your surgery. Your doctor will tell you if you should stop taking any of them before the surgery and how soon to do it. \u2022 Make sure your doctor and the hospital have a copy of your goals of care plan. It lets others know your health care wishes. It's a good thing to have before any type of surgery or procedure. Plan Ahead \u2022 Plan a ride home. Ask a family member or friend to bring you home after your hospital visit and stay with you for 24 hours \u2022 Plan for meals. Good nutrition is important for your recovery, but cooking may be harder to do right after you get home. Prepare and freeze meals before your surgery or ask friends and family to help you cook or shop for groceries. \u2022 Get help with chores. After you get home you may need help. For a short time after your surgery, you may be told to avoid certain physical activities. Plan ahead and arrange to have some help with chores after your surgery. \u2022 Buy gum or hard candies. Chewing gum and sucking on hard candies may help get your bowels moving after surgery. Be as healthy as possible \u2022 Be active. Being active before surgery will make it easier for you to be active after surgery. If you\u2019re normally active, keep doing your regular activities up to the day of your surgery. If you aren\u2019t used to exercising, start slowly. You can start by going for 15 minute walks. \u2022 Eat healthy. Eating healthy foods will give your body the nutrients it needs to prepare for and handle the surgery. Eat healthy foods and drink enough fluids in the weeks before your surgery. Your healthcare team will tell you how long before surgery that you need to stop eating and drinking. \u2022 Manage your medical conditions. If you have other medical conditions, such as anemia or high or low blood sugar, ask your healthcare team what you need to do to prepare for surgery. \u2022 Quit tobacco. You can heal faster and prevent lung problems after surgery if you quit tobacco. Aim to quit smoking and using tobacco and tobacco-like products at least 4 weeks before surgery. Talk to your healthcare team about ways to quit or cut back. \u2022 Don\u2019t drink alcohol 24 hours before surgery. Alcohol, cannabis, and other drugs may interact with medicines you take before and after surgery. Talk to your healthcare team if you need help stopping or cutting back on alcohol, cannabis, or other drugs. Do the following before your surgery to help you feel better sooner and recover faster. The day before surgery \u2022 Know the time of your surgery, when you need to be at the hospital, and where you need to go when you get there. \u2022 Follow any instructions the healthcare team or your surgeon gave you for your medicines (including herbal or complementary medicines). \u2022 Don\u2019t drink alcohol 24 hours before your surgery. \u2022 Stop eating at midnight. This is very important! \u2022 Stop eating and drinking all non-clear fluids at midnight. This is very important \u2022 You may DRINK CLEAR FLUIDS ONLY up to 3 hours before surgery. This includes BLACK coffee, tea, Gatorade, apple juice and water. Morning of surgery Plan to arrive at the hospital on time. \u2022 Follow any instructions provided \u2022 Bring all of the things you packed for your hospital stay if you are being admitted. \u2022 Follow all other instructions the healthcare team gave you to prepare for surgery. \u2022 Bring your CPAP if you use one What ",

Hagadorn Rd Suite 600 East Lansing, MI, 48823 517.267.2460 Surgery | Mastectomy Post-Operative Instructions FOLLOW UP APPOINTMENT \u2022 Follow-up with your surgeon in 1-2 weeks for your post-operative appointment, or as previously scheduled. PATHOLOGY RESULTS \u2022 The pathology results from your surgery will take 3 \u2013 5 days to be completed. It may be longer if your surgery was done towards the end of the week. Our office will call you when the results are back, or your surgeon will review the results at your first post- operative visit. INCISION CARE \u2022 The gauze dressing can be removed three (3) days after your surgery. \u2022 If the gauze bandage gets wet or saturated, replace it with a clean, dry bandage. \u2022 You will have an incision in the side of breast removal in the chest. There are dissolvable stitches under the skin and white tapes called steri strips on the surface of the skin. Let them fall off on their own. There are no sutures at the skin level that need to be removed. Except the ones holding drains in place. \u2022 The incision may feel more dense/harder initially or you may feel a lump. This is expected after surgery and usually resolves over time. The stitches used to close the tissue under the skin are in multiple layers and can cause the fullness. They dissolve on their own. \u2022 Some bruising and swelling around the incision are expected. \u2022 Do not apply lotion, ointment, or cream to your incision. \u2022 There will be one-two (1-2) drains in place. Drains should be emptied at least twice daily. A dressing must be kept around the drains at all times. Drains cannot get wet. Do not shower while the drains are in. \u2022 Wear your elastic corset for at least three (3) days after surgery. You can begin wearing a bra once it feels comfortable for you. Dr. Bumpers will give you a knitted knocker (handmade breast prosthesis) to put in your bra. Once you have healed, he will write a prescription for a prosthesis and bras. \u2022 You may use an ice pack over the incision. Never put ice or an ice pack directly on your skin, wrap in a towel. Do not use the ice pack for more than fifteen (15) minutes at a time. A small pillow positioned in your armpit may also help with the discomfort. \u2022 Your surgeon uses a long-acting local anesthetic during surgery which helps with postoperative pain. Take pain medicine as directed. Do not wait until the pain gets bad before taking them. \u2022 Do not drink alcohol while on pain medicines. Use the prescription pain medication as prescribed. Once you start feeling better, you can use Tylenol or ibuprofen for discomfort. Some pain medications may cause constipation. You may use a stool softener or laxative if needed. DRAIN CARE \u2022 A Jackson-Pratt drain provides a constant low suction to pull excess fluid from your surgical site for faster healing and prevent buildup of fluid under the incision. You will have two drains per breast. \u2022 Initially the fluid will be red, then turn a watery red and a clear yellow. \u2022 Always wash your hand with soap and water before and after changing the dressing or emptying the bulb. \u2022 Changing the Dressing: If drain dressing is dry and intact for first three (3) days after surgery, you do not o need to change. Change the dressing only if it is wet. Remove the old dressing. Unpin the drain from your clothing. o Clean the skin around the drain tube site with betadine-soaked cotton tipped o applicator (or gauze) in circular motion. Be careful not to tug on sutures. Check the skin around the drain tube site for redness, tenderness, swelling, warmth, o unusual drainage, and leakage. Wash Hands. Place clean, dry gauze over the drain tube insertion site and secure it with tape. o \u2022 Emptying the Bulb: Open the stopper slowly (away from your face). Empty the contents into the o measuring container at least twice daily or when drain is about half full. Squeeze the bulb while it is uncapped. While squeezing, recap the bulb to create o suction. It should look flat or deflated when suction is working. Pin the bulb drain back to your clothing by the plastic tag to avoid accidental pulling. o Discard the drainage into the toilet. Rinse and wash the measuring container with soap and water. Record the amount and note the color and type of the drainage. The drain will be o removed in the office. The suture is cut, and the drainage tube is gently pulled out. A gauze dressing is applied, and the opening closes in a few days. ACTIVITY RESTRICTIONS \u2022 You will stay in the hospital overnight after surgery. \u2022 Avoid heavy lifting and vigorous exercise until stitches are removed. \u2022 Avoid using arms for repetitive arm motion (Ex. Vacuuming) \u2022 Frequent short walks are helpful. \u2022 You cannot drive or do housework until the drain is out. You may restart driving when you are no longer on prescription pain medication, you feel safe operating a car, and have spoken with surgeon. \u2022 Move your arm on the surgical side so it does not become stiff but do not do any ",

      "text_content": "LUMPECTOMY/PARTIAL MASTECTOMY INSTRUCTIONS INSTRUCTIONS BEFORE SURGERY (PREOPERATIVE): This is usually a same day surgical procedure. If necessary, you may stay longer. 1) Designate a driver. Medications given during your procedure slow your response time. Please have a responsible adult accompany you or available to take you home. Going home by yourself in a taxi is not permitted. 2) Nothing to eat or drink after midnight. Your surgery will be cancelled if you eat or drink after midnight on the night before your operation. Food in the stomach puts you at risk for breathing in (aspirating) food particles. You may take your daily morning medications with sips of water. If you take a blood thinner (Coumadin) or have diabetes, heart disease or other illness requiring medications, contact your surgeon or primary care physician for specific directions. 3) Do not take Aspirin. Refrain from taking aspirin, aspirin containing products, \u201cgoody powders\u201d, or vitamin E for 5 days prior to surgery. 4) Wear comfortable clothes. Wear clothes that are easy to put on. Tops or dresses that are loose fitting and button or zip up the front are easier to slip over your surgical dressing. Postoperatively, you may be given a wireless bra to be worn over your dressings. You may also plan on bringing a sportsbra or front closure bra with you as this will be easier to wear immediately after surgery. Recommended items to bring with you: Leave all valuables at home or with family/friends CD/Tape player and headphones, favorite music or book/magazine Important phone numbers INSTRUCTIONS AFTER SURGERY (POSTOPERATIVE): 1) Medications/pain management \u25cf Restart all of your regular medications unless specifically told otherwise. \u25cf Rate your own level of discomfort/pain. It is easier to control pain by taking medications before the pain becomes severe. \u25cf We recommend taking the following medications on a regular schedule. Tylenol 325mg 1-3 tabs every 6 hours for the first day and/or Ibuprofen 200mg 1-3 tabs every 6 hours (with food) \u25cf If your pain is still uncontrolled Oxycodone 5mg 1-2 tabs every 3 to 4 hours as needed for breakthrough pain \u25cf Do NOT drink or drive while taking oxycodone. \u25cf You may experience constipation while taking oxycodone. Increasing your fluid intake or taking an over-the-counter stool softener may help. \u25cf Ice packs may also help to reduce pain and swelling. They can be used every 3-4 hours for ten minutes at a time. Warm compresses are not to be used near the incision. \u25cf Some women experience a sore throat from the ventilation tube used in the operating room. Lozenges or throat spray may help. 2) Incision and dressing care \u25cf A supportive bra may have been placed over your dressings. Wear your bra for the next 3-4 days, it will help minimize postoperative bleeding and swelling. You can even wear the bra to bed at night. \u25cf If you have a dressing, it may consist of white gauze and tape. This dressing may be removed in 2 days. \u25cf Under the dressing, your incision has both sutures and steri-strips (small, white, strips of tape) or sutures and special skin glue. The sutures will be asorbed by your skin tissue over time. When used the surgical tapes, steri-strips, should remain over your wound for 7-10 days. It is ok if the steri-strips fall off earlier. The skin glue will gradually wear away. \u25cf If your wound has skin glue, you may shower the day after your operation. If your incision has steri strips and a bandage, the bandage may be removed two days after surgery so that you can shower. In either case, no baths or soaking of the wound (bath tub, hot tub, whirl pool, ocean) for 2 weeks. 3) Diet \u25cf Resume your regular diet as tolerated. 4) Activity \u25cf Avoid strenuous activity, heavy lifting (greater than 30 pounds) and vigorous exercise until seen in follow-up. \u25cf Walking and most daily activity may be resumed the day after surgery. \u25cf Most people return to desk-type work in 1-2 days.

      "text_content": "Mastectomy & Axillary Surgery A Patient Care Guide for Before and After Surgery Breast Care Center Introduction: Mastectomy and Axillary Surgery Mastectomy A mastectomy is a surgery to remove all the breast tissue from a breast. Your surgeon will dissect (cut out) the breast tissue from under the skin and off of the wall of your chest underneath your breast. A total mastectomy is surgery to remove your entire breast, including the nipple, areola (the darker area skin around the nipple), and the skin over your breast to allow your skin to close and heal flat over the wall of your chest. Many patients having a total mastectomy will also have reconstruction of the breast (a procedure to rebuild the shape and look of their breast). Your surgeon may do breast reconstruction at the same time as your mastectomy (called immediate reconstruction) or at a later date after your mastectomy (called delayed reconstruction). Reconstruction may be done using implants (which usually require a tissue expander or temporary implant first) or your own tissue (called flap reconstruction) to rebuild the breast shape, or breast mound. You can get more details about reconstruction by talking to a plastic surgeon. If you are having an immediate breast reconstruction, your surgeon will do either a skin-sparing or nipple-sparing mastectomy. \u2022 A skin-sparing mastectomy is surgery to remove the entire breast, nipple, and areola while leaving the surrounding breast skin (called an \u201cenvelope\u201d of breast skin) to cover the reconstructed breast mound. \u2022 A nipple-sparing mastectomy is surgery to remove all the breast tissue but leave the breast skin, nipple, and areola. Then, your surgeon can use this skin and nipple \u201cenvelope\u201d to cover the breast reconstruction. Whether or not a nipple-sparing mastectomy is a good option for a patient is based on their breast shape and size as well as their cancer Rogel Cancer Center Mastectomy & Axillary Surgery: A Patient Care Guide for Before and After Surgery - 2 - details. Your surgical team will talk with you about whether a nipple- sparing mastectomy is right for you. After a mastectomy and axillary surgery, fluid normally builds up in the area where your breast tissue was removed. For most patients getting a mastectomy, the surgeon will leave 1 or more thin plastic tubes (catheters) in the area where you had surgery. This is to drain the fluid that builds up after surgery. The drain is attached to a bulb with a cap. The surgical team will teach you how to care for these drains. Depending on the amount of fluid that collects in the bulb, the drains are usually removed 1-3 weeks after the surgery. Axillary surgery Axillary surgery, or lymph node surgery, is an important procedure. It can help your doctor find out whether breast cancer cells have spread to the nearby lymph nodes (small bean-shaped structures that filter substances throughout your body). Then, they can recommend treatment that gives you the best chance of becoming and staying cancer-free. There are 2 types of lymph node surgery: sentinel lymph node biopsy and axillary lymph node dissection. Sentinel lymph node biopsy A sentinel lymph node biopsy is a procedure that tests your axillary lymph nodes (lymph nodes in the underarm or armpit) for cancer. The sentinel lymph nodes are the first lymph nodes to which the cancer spreads, or drains. The doctor will find your sentinel lymph nodes by injecting different solutions (liquid mixtures of water and other materials) into the breast, such as a blue dye, weak radioactive tracer, or magnetic tracer. These solutions move to and build up in the sentinel nodes, making it easier for the surgeon to see the sentinel lymph nodes. In the operating room, the surgeon will make an incision (cut) in the axilla (underarm) to locate and remove the sentinel lymph nodes. Most patients have 2 sentinel lymph nodes, but some patients have only 1 and Rogel Cancer Center Mastectomy & Axillary Surgery: A Patient Care Guide for Before and After Surgery - 3 - some patients have 3 or more. The amount of tissue removed with the sentinel lymph node biopsy is very small, so the doctor won\u2019t have to leave a drainage tube in your body after the surgery. The risk of side effects (such as lymphedema, or swelling from a build-up of lymph fluid) is low. Axillary lymph node dissection Axillary lymph node dissection is a more extensive lymph node surgery that is appropriate for some patients if cancer has spread to the lymph nodes, or if the doctor can\u2019t do a sentinel lymph node biopsy for technical reasons (scar tissue, dye not reaching the lymph nodes, etc.). To perform the axillary lymph node dissection, the surgeon makes an incision in your armpit under your arm and removes the fatty tissue where the lymph nodes are located. Most patients have between 10 and 20 lymph nodes in the tissue that is removed during the axillary lymph node dissection. However, the actual number of lymph nodes is different for each patient.

It\u2019s important that you think carefully about each of your choices and weigh the benefits of each treatment option against the possible risks and side effects. Local treatments Some treatments, like surgery and radiation, are local, meaning they treat the tumor without affecting the rest of the body. Most women with breast cancer will have some type of surgery to remove the tumor. Depending on the type of breast cancer and how advanced it is, you might need other types of treatment as well, either before or after surgery, or sometimes both. Surgery for Breast Cancer l Radiation for Breast Cancer l Systemic treatments Drugs used to treat breast cancer are considered systemic therapies because they can reach cancer cells almost anywhere in the body. Some can be given by mouth, injected into a muscle, or put directly into the bloodstream. Depending on the type of breast cancer, different types of drug treatment might be used, including: Chemotherapy for Breast Cancer l Hormone Therapy for Breast Cancer l Targeted Drug Therapy for Breast Cancer l Immunotherapy for Breast Cancer l 1 _A_m__e_ri_ca_n_ _C_a_n_c_e_r_ S_o_c_i_e_ty_________________________________________c_a_n_c_e_r._o_rg_ _| _1_.8_0_0_._2_2_7_.2_3_4_5__ Common treatment approaches Typically, treatment is based on the type of breast cancer and its stage. Other factors, including your overall health, menopause status, and personal preferences are also taken into account. Treatment of Breast Cancer by Stage l Treatment of Triple-negative Breast Cancer l Treatment of Inflammatory Breast Cancer l Treating Breast Cancer During Pregnancy l Who treats breast cancer? Based on your treatment options, you might have different types of doctors on your treatment team. These doctors could include: A breast surgeon or surgical oncologist: a doctor who uses surgery to treat l breast cancer A radiation oncologist: a doctor who uses radiation to treat cancer l A medical oncologist: a doctor who uses chemotherapy, hormone therapy, l immunotherapy, and other medicines to treat cancer A plastic surgeon: a doctor who specializes in reconstructing or repairing parts of l the body You might have many other specialists on your treatment team as well, including physician assistants (PAs), nurse practitioners (NPs), nurses, psychologists, nutritionists, social workers, patient/nurse navigators, and other health professionals. Health Professionals Who Are Part of a Cancer Care Team l Making treatment decisions It\u2019s important to discuss all of your treatment options, including their goals and possible side effects, with your doctors to help make the decision that best fits your needs. It\u2019s also very important to ask questions if there's anything you\u2019re not sure about. If time permits, it is often a good idea to seek a second opinion.

ACS CARES volunteers provide one-on-one support through the mobile app to help those facing breast cancer cope with diagnosis, treatment, side effects and more. Thinking about taking part in a clinical trial Clinical trials are carefully controlled research studies that are done to get a closer look at promising new treatments or procedures. Clinical trials are one way to get state-of- the-art cancer treatment. In some cases they may be the only way to get access to newer treatments. They are also the best way for doctors to learn better methods to treat cancer. If you would like to learn more about clinical trials that might be right for you, start by asking your doctor if your clinic or hospital conducts clinical trials. Clinical Trials l Considering complementary, integrative, and alternative methods You may hear about alternative or complementary methods to relieve symptoms or treat your cancer that your doctors haven\u2019t mentioned. These methods can include vitamins, herbs, and special diets, or other methods such as acupuncture or massage, to name a few. Complementary methods are treatments that are used along with your regular medical care. Alternative treatments are used instead of standard medical treatment. Although some of these methods might be helpful in relieving symptoms or helping you feel better, many have not been proven to work. Some might even be harmful. For example, some supplements might interfere with chemotherapy. Be sure to talk to your cancer care team about any method ",

      "text_content": "CARING FOR YOURSELF FOLLOWING A TOTAL MASTECTOMY This fact sheet has general instructions for patients following a total mastectomy. As individual circumstances can vary, it is important that you discuss your post-operative care with us. Incision There will be no stitches (sutures) at the surface of your incision. There will be dissolvable sutures under the skin and the incision will be covered with a waterproof dressing. It is best to discuss the positioning and size of your scar with your surgeon as this will vary from patient to patient. The waterproof dressing will remain in place until you are reviewed in Breast Clinic (usually 12 days later). You may have an added firm dressing over the waterproof dressing. This outer dressing can be removed after 24 hours, leaving the waterproof dressing in place until your review. You will be advised of this if it is needed. You are able to shower as normal, but are advised to avoid hot showers as they may increase the amount of bruising or swelling. Once the dressing is removed the suture line will be covered with surgical tape (such as Micropore; available at any pharmacy). It is recommended you use the tape for six weeks, changing it every five to seven days. This will help to minimise the scar. Rubbing creams and oils into the suture line is discouraged until after this six-week period. Drain tube A drain tube will be placed into the wound bed at the time of surgery to remove excess fluid. The surgeon will decide when to remove the drain tube. It will usually remain in place for two to five days until you have less than 50mls of drainage in a 24-hour period. If you are discharged home from hospital with the drain still in place, you will be given instructions to help care for the drain and a nurse will visit you at home to remove it. The tube may be uncomfortable. You may want to take pain relief half an hour before it is removed as the procedure can be painful. When the drain tube is removed the small hole will be closed with a dressing, this must be removed after 48 hours. Pain You are likely to have mild to moderate pain or discomfort after surgery. You will be given pain relief tablets and you may take these as required for the first one to two weeks. Physical activity A physiotherapist will give you gentle arm exercises to do in the first few weeks following your surgery. Regular gentle exercises is important to reduce the possible complication of a stiff shoulder. It is important that you avoid heavy physical activity for the first two weeks. For the next four weeks slowly increase your physical activity as you become more comfortable. After six weeks you should be able to resume your normal level of activity. Check with your surgeon before you recommence vigorous exercise or heavy lifting. CARING FOR YOURSELF FOLLOWING A TOTAL MASTECTOMY D15-019 - NOVEMBER 2018 www.rmh.mh.org.au www.thewomens.org.au Comfort and appearance While you\u2019re encouraged to look at your scar line as soon as you feel ready, it is a very personal journey and one you should feel in control of. The breast care nurse is available to help you do this. It can be helpful to look at photographs of mastectomy scars prior to your surgery to prepare for the change in your appearance. The breast care nurse can assist with this. If you are in a relationship, sharing the pre-surgery preparation and discussion can be helpful in preparing for change. Following your surgery the breast care nurse will fit you with a post-surgery bra. This bra provides comfort and support and has a pocket within the cup that can hold breast padding if desired. The breast care nurse can show you how to mould the padding into a breast shape that is similar to your natural breast. This can be done initiallywith the use of a cotton-filled cushion (called a softie). As it is soft and light, it will not put pressure on your scar line. The breast care nurse can also give you information about options for long-term breast shape within your bra. Wearing a bra with a softie or breast prosthesis is optional. It is safe to wear your bra and softie as soon as you are comfortable. Women wanting to be fitted for a breast prosthesis are advised to do so at six weeks post-surgery, this allows time for any swelling or bruising to settle. You may feel self-conscious about breast symmetry. If this is the case, asymmetric prints on clothing can be helpful, as can wearing loose or layered clothing or a scarf draped around your neck. Illustration courtesy of St Andrews Centre for Burns and Plastic Surgery at Broomfield Hospital, Chelmsford UK Post-operative care Following surgery it is not unusual to have some swelling or bruising; this should gradually settle over the first few weeks. It is important to contact the hospital if you notice a sudden increase in swelling. Swelling may be due to the accumulation of fluid at the site of the operation, this is called a seroma. This is a common occurrence; the body will often absorb this fluid ov",

You may be receiving a lot of information, and the Johns Hopkins Plastic Surgery Team is here to help you from beginning to end. It is important to remember that every person is different. Your care team will tailor your recovery program to your needs. This booklet contains details about: \u2022 Getting ready for your surgery \u2022 What to expect on the day of surgery \u2022 Planning for recovery and going home \u2022 What to expect once you are home To make this journey easier, please try to read this booklet as soon as you are able to and bring it with you to all of your appointments and hospitalizations. Keep track of your questions and be sure to ask your surgical team when you see them. It is important for you, your family and your friends to understand what to anticipate so that everyone can fully participate in your recovery. Best wishes for a speedy recovery! The Johns Hopkins Plastic Surgery Team Enhanced Recovery After Surgery Information for patients and caregivers undergoing Mastectomy with Tissue Expanders surgery Purpose of this book To help guide you through the Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS) program. It is important that everyone knows what to expect before, during and after your operation. Treatment is always individualized to each patient, so this packet is intended as a guide. Please ask a member of the healthcare team if anything remains unclear, or if you have any questions or concerns. What is ERAS? Enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) is a new approach designed to help you recover faster and reduce complications. You are actively involved in your recovery process. ERAS will help you return to your regular activities sooner. Four main components of ERAS: 1. Planning and preparation for surgery 2. Reducing the stress of surgery 3. Pain management \u2013 we will provide options that speed up your recovery 4. Getting you to eat and walk sooner This program is most effective when you are actively involved in your recovery. We will work with you in your recovery to keep your stay as short as possible. You should expect to be in the hospital for approximately 1 - 2 days. Your Checklist 2 | Your Guide to Colorectal Surgery Patient Name__________________________________ Date of Surgery_________________ Use this summary checklist as a guide to what you need to do to prepare for your surgery and recovery after surgery. CHECK WHEN ACTION DONE ONE MONTH BEFORE SURGERY View assigned education programs. Prepare your medical records for your pre-operative evaluation. Have your pre-operative evaluation with either the Pre-Operative Evaluation Center (PEC) at Johns Hopkins or your primary care provider to review your medical history and if you need to stop or change any of your medications prior to surgery. Plan for management of blood thinners Warfarin, clopidogiel, aspirin, etc. will be done by your surgical team and prescribing doctor, if appropriate. Complete your pre-operative testing including: lab work, chest x-ray, and EKG as required. This can be completed at Johns Hopkins or your primary care provider. Stop taking hormones including birth control and Tamoxifen. You should plan to stay one night in the hospital following surgery. It is likely that you will need assistance from family or friends immediately after leaving the hospital. Try to pick one family member or friend who can be part of the team to help make decisions and coordinate your care. 10 DAYS BEFORE SURGERY Ensure your surgeon\u2019s office has received copies of your medical records including the history and physical and copies of the completed pre-operative testing. Stop taking aspirin or ibuprofen (e.g. Motrin, Advil, Aleve), vitamin E, multivitamin and any herbal supplements. They may cause increased bleeding during and after surgery. Tylenol is okay to take. Purchase the liquid medicated soap Hibiclens available at any pharmacy over the counter. Patient Name__________________________________ Date of Surgery_______________ CHECK WHEN ACTION DONE A few simple things to do before coming to the hospital that may make it easier for you when you return home: In the kitchen, put the things you use often between waist and shoulder height to avoid having to bend down or stretch to reach them. Bring the things you are going to use during the day downstairs. However, realize you WILL be able to climb stairs after surgery.

      "text_content": "Guideline Resource Unit guru@ahs.ca Breast Reconstruction Following Prophylactic or Therapeutic Mastectomy for Breast Cancer Effective Date: February, 2017 Clinical Practice Guideline BR-016 \u2013 Version 2 www.ahs.ca/guru Background Local treatment for early breast cancer has shown the equivalence of total mastectomy and breast conservation surgery plus radiation therapy as it relates to overall survival.1 As a result, current guidelines on the surgical management of breast cancer recommend lumpectomy and whole breast irradiation as an oncologically equivalent option to mastectomy for patients with stage I or stage II invasive breast cancer.2-5 Prophylactic bilateral mastectomy may also be considered as a risk reduction strategy for patients at high risk of developing breast cancer.3,6,7,8 For women who do undergo mastectomy, whether for therapeutic or for prophylactic reasons, the side effects of mastectomy can be significant. Anxiety and depression, poor body image, sexual issues, and phantom breast syndrome have been well-documented among patients who have undergone mastectomy.9-14 However, breast reconstruction may alleviate some of the postmastectomy distress experienced by these patients.15-17 The purpose of this guideline is to provide practitioners in Alberta with recommendations on the selection of candidates for breast reconstruction, the decision on how much tissue to remove during mastectomy, the timing of reconstruction procedures, the selection of an appropriate reconstruction, and the impact of breast reconstruction on adjuvant therapy. Guideline Questions The questions below are consensus-based and were derived from a discussion among the members of the guideline working group. 1. Who should receive breast reconstruction education information? 2. Who is a candidate for postmastectomy breast reconstruction? 3. Which types of breast reconstruction are available? 4. What is the appropriate timing of breast reconstruction? 5. What is appropriate extent of mastectomy (i.e., skin-sparing, nipple-sparing)? 6. What are the risks and benefits associated with breast reconstruction? 7. What is the role of acellular dermal matrix in implant-based breast reconstruction? 8. What is the role of autologous fat grafting as an adjunct to breast reconstruction? 9. How can recovery be improved in breast reconstruction patients? 10. What is the appropriate post-breast reconstruction surveillance? 11. How do we measure outcomes in breast reconstruction? Search Strategy Peer-reviewed articles were searched on February 29, 2016 and March 14, 2016 using PubMed, the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Evidence-Based Medicine (EMB) Database. The following search terms were used: breast cancer, breast neoplasm, breast carcinoma, breast tumour/tumor, ablative surgery, mastectomy, ablation therapy, breast reconstruction, and mammoplasty. Results were limited to human participants >19 L ast re vised: February 2017 Guideline Resource Unit 2 years of age, studies published in English, and publications from November, 2012 to March, 2016. Additional exclusion criteria included studies with <25 patients, and studies with singular focuses on costs, patient-reported outcome measures, imaging and prognostic factors. In total, 362 articles were identified, of which 54 were reviewed in detail based on a title/abstract screen. The National Guideline Clearinghouse (NGC, Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, www.guideline.gov) was searched for clinical practice guidelines related to breast reconstruction. In addition, the webpages of well-recognized cancer guideline developers was hand-searched to ensure no clinical practice guidelines had been missed. Target Population The recommendations contained in this guideline apply to women over the age of 18 years who are candidates for mastectomy, either for the treatment of breast cancer or for the prophylaxis of breast cancer in patients at high genetic risk. Recommendations 1. Patient education. Women with breast cancer or those deemed to be at high risk for developing breast cancer (e.g. BRCA 1 and 2 mutation carriers) should receive standardized information about breast reconstruction early in their decision making process. Patients who are to undergo either therapeutic or prophylactic mastectomy should receive detailed, individually tailored information to assist with decision making, including appropriate breast reconstruction consultation if desired. 2. Eligibility for postmastectomy breast reconstruction. Various patient and treatment factors affect the options, risks, and outcomes of breast reconstruction. Consultation with an expert in breast reconstruction can provide a patient with a specialized treatment plan and anticipated outcomes, risks, and benefits so she can determine if breast reconstruction is appropriate for her. Factors that should be weighed when considering candidates for any method of breast reconstruction",

        "Risk reducing surgery with prophylactic mastectomy and reconstruction may be offered to high risk women such as those carrying BRCA1 or BRCA2 gene mutations or those with previous mantle irradiation for lymphoma.23 In patients undergoing reconstructive breast surgery, an evaluation of psychological morbidity showed that recalled distress about mastectomy was lower among those who had reconstruction immediately (i.e., at the time of mastectomy) or early (i.e., within one year), whereas those who had delayed reconstruction (i.e., more than one year later) had significantly more recalled distress about mastectomy.15 Similarly, a comparison between immediate (n=25) and delayed (n=38) breast reconstruction, using a standardized symptom inventory (BSI) and a self-report questionnaire, revealed that only 25% of the women who underwent immediate breast reconstruction (IBR) reported \"high distress\" about mastectomy, versus 60% of the delayed reconstruction group (p=0.02)",
        "For autologous breast reconstruction, ERAS protocols reduce opioid requirements and length of stay.228,229 For implant-based reconstruction, women can be moved safely from in- to out-patient care with higher quality of recovery scores and no increased complications using ERAS principles, provided adequate outpatient supports are in place.230 Pedicled TRAM and latissimus dorsi patients have achieved early discharge under 24 hours with enhanced recovery protocols.231,232 Mobile app follow-up monitoring quality of recovery for patients at home is feasible and acceptable.233,234 10",

        "Reoperation is frequently required in patients who develop partial flap necrosis, and always required in cases of complete necrosis.161 Less common complications from autologous breast reconstruction include bruising, bleeding, and chronic pain.162,163 Liu164 compared 75 flap and 179 expander/implant reconstruction patients and found notable rates of complications in each group (21% flap, 37% expander/implant), and a shorter length of stay (LOS) for expander patients (2.1 vs 4.8 days)",

A member of your health care team will review your medications at your history and physical visit. They will tell you which medications to stop before surgery, and which to take on the morning of your surgery with sips of water. How can I prepare for my hospital stay? \u2022 Quit smoking and vaping! The sooner you quit before surgery, the better. Patients who smoke up until the day of surgery are at higher risk of developing complications during and after surgery. If you continue to smoke you will be more likely to have: o A longer stay in the hospital o A greater chance of needing intensive care o Increased risk of poor wound healing o Increased risk of death If you want assistance to quit smoking prior to surgery, ask for a referral to the MHealthy Tobacco Consultation Service or call them yourself at (734) 998-6222. Other resources: o The Michigan Tobacco Quit line: 1-800-QUIT-NOW (free resource) o The Truth Initiative: www.becomeanex.org o US Department of Health and Human Services: www.smokefree.gov Plan to bring any special equipment you use at home: \u2022 Glasses, dentures, and hearing aids with storage cases.

Methods: The guideline is based on scientific evidence completed with expert opinion on the matter. By summarising and evaluating the best available evidence, recommendations for the evaluation and treatment of patients have been formulated. The recommendations are graded according to a modified European Society of Cardiology grading system, where the strength (class) of each recommendation is graded from I to III and the letters A to C mark the level of evidence. Results: A total of 160 recommendations have been issued on the following topics: Service standards, including surgical volume and training; Epidemiology, diagnosis, and screening; Management of patients with small abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA), including surveillance, cardiovascular risk reduction, and indication for repair; Elective AAA repair, including operative risk assessment, open and endovascular repair, and early complications; RupturedandsymptomaticAAA,includingperi-operativemanagement,suchaspermissivehypotensionanduseof aorticocclusionballoon,openandendovascularrepair,andearlycomplications,suchasabdominalcompartment syndrome and colonic ischaemia; Long term outcome and follow up after AAA repair, including graft infection, endoleaks and follow up routines; Management of complex AAA, including open and endovascular repair; Management of iliac artery aneurysm, including indication for repair and open and endovascular repair; and Miscellaneousaorticproblems,includingmycotic,inflammatory,andsaccularaorticaneurysm.Inaddition,Shared decisionmakingisbeingaddressed,withsupportinginformationforpatients,andUnresolvedissuesarediscussed. Conclusion: The ESVS Clinical Practice Guidelines provide the most comprehensive, up to date, and unbiased advice to clinicians and patients on the management of abdominal aorto-iliac artery aneurysms.

Please remove the dressing the following morning but ensure you leave the underlying steristrips intact. If the steristrips covering the incisions in the leg start to lift in the first week, reinforce them with the steristrips provided to you on discharge. Stockings: Stockings are to be worn all day for the first three weeks after surgery. You must leave your stocking on until you are going to bed and reapply it upon rising in the morning. You may also remove your stocking for showering. Analgesia: Take Panadol as required. If you have allergies or other medical conditions that preclude you from taking Panadol, please discuss this with the anaesthetist. Mobility: Once you are discharged from hospital, you are to walk twice a day for 20 minutes each walk. Try to avoid excessive stairs or hills and walk at a comfortable pace. Do not attempt any sporting activities or swimming until Dr Puttaswamy reviews you. Do not stand for any prolonged periods of time and keep your leg elevated when you are at rest. Avoid driving for the first seven days. At this stage ensure that you feel comfortable to drive and start with a short distance as a trial. Bruising: The bruising on your leg will generally increase over the first week. Once you have been assessed by our Practice Nurse, you will be encouraged to gently massage Hirudoid cream into the bruised areas, avoiding any incisions. The bruising gradually improves but may last up to 6 to 8 weeks. Showering: You may remove your stocking for showering. You are allowed to get your leg wet, however it is advisable not to have a bath or soak your wounds. When you are drying your leg, please ensure you pat it dry and do not rub at all with a towel. Air Travel: Following surgery you should not undertake air travel for 6 - 8 weeks and you will require final clearance from Dr Puttaswamy before travelling. Follow Up: Please telephone our rooms on 9439 8715 to arrange your post operative visit with our Practice Nurse. This is approximately seven to ten days after your surgery. We will also book your post operative consultation with Dr Puttaswamy which will be two weeks after that day. Concerns: If you have any concerns, please contact our rooms immediately on 9439 8715. In particular, if your wounds are increasingly red or painful or if your leg feels hot to touch. If our rooms are unattended, please contact North Shore Private Hospital on 8425 3000.

Methods A principal literature search was performed utilizing the Pubmed, EMBASE, Cochrane databases and ClinicalTrials.gov through December 2020, with particular attention paid to meta-analyses, randomized controlled trials and large prospective cohort studies. Selected studies were examined, reviewed and graded according to the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) system. After critical appraisal of these studies, the group of authors reached consensus regarding recommendations. Results The quality of evidence for many ERAS interventions remains relatively low in a bariatric setting and evidence-based practices may need to be extrapolated from other surgeries.

It also has information about what will happen on the day of surgery and your care after surgery, including when you go home. Members of your health-care team will go over this guide with you. We know this may be a stressful time for you and you will get a lot of information about your medical condition. This booklet will help you keep track of what you need to do before and after your surgery. If you have any questions about the material in this booklet, please contact your vascular surgeon\u2019s office. Use the timeline on pages 2 to 4 to write dates and times of all your appointments for your leg bypass surgery. In this booklet, there are pages for you to write notes of your own. What is Leg Bypass Surgery? Leg bypass \u2013 also known as lower extremity bypass \u2013 is a surgery that improves the blood flow to the leg if your arteries are severely narrowed or blocked. Because of your narrowed or blocked arteries, you may have pain and discomfort in your thigh, calf or foot that gets worse when you walk. You may also develop wounds in your leg and/or foot that are difficult to heal. To fix your blood flow, a surgeon uses blood vessels (veins) from another area of the body, like your arm or leg, to avoid (or \u201cbypass\u201d) the blockage by rerouting the blood from one area to another. The surgeon may choose to use an artificial graft if your vein is not a good fit for the procedure. Depending on your condition, you may have multiple bypasses in one surgery.

WITH TIME, NEW ROUTINES WILL BECOME SECOND NATURE. REHABILITATION CAN BUILD YOUR STRENGTH, CAPABILITY AND CONFIDENCE. IT CAN HELP YOU CONTINUE YOUR DAILY ACTIVITIES DESPITE THE EFFECTS OF YOUR STROKE. If you are the caregiver, family member or friend of a stroke survivor, your role is vital. You should know the prevention plan and help your loved one to comply with the plan. With a committed health care team and a rehabilitation plan specific to their needs, most stroke survivors can prevent another stroke and thrive. We hope this guide will help you and your loved ones understand the effects of stroke and how to maximize your rehabilitation and recovery. 03 WHAT IS A STROKE? Stroke is an event that affects the arteries of the brain. A stroke occurs when a blood vessel bringing blood to the brain gets blocked or ruptures (bursts). This means that the area of the brain the blocked or ruptured blood vessel supplies can\u2019t get the oxygen and nutrients it needs. Without oxygen, nerve cells can\u2019t function. Your brain controls your ability to move, feel, think and behave. Brain injury from a stroke may affect any of these functions. Several factors affect the ways people experience a stroke. They include: \u2022 THE LOCATION OF THE BLOOD VESSEL THAT IS AFFECTED \u2022 THE AREA AND EXTENT OF THE BRAIN INJURY \u2022 THE TYPE OF STROKE (ISCHEMIC VS. HEMORRHAGIC) 04 TYPES OF STROKE Ischemic stroke occurs when a clot Hemorrhagic stroke happens when blocks a vessel supplying blood to the a blood vessel bursts (ruptures) in the brain. The artery becomes narrowed or brain. This type of stroke may affect clogged, cutting off blood flow to brain large arteries in the brain or the small cells. Ischemic strokes are the most blood vessels deep within the brain. The common type of stroke. rupture keeps the surrounding areas of the brain from getting needed oxygen. Hemorrhagic strokes are less common than ischemic strokes. Lodged Blood Clot Cerebral Atherosclerosis Hemorrhage Transient ischemic attacks (TIAs) are often called \u201cwarning strokes.\u201d TIAs produce symptoms just like stroke, but typically last a shorter amount of time. They don\u2019t usually cause lasting damage. But they are major predictors of future stroke. If you suspect you\u2019ve had or are having a TIA, don\u2019t ignore it! Call 9-1-1. Get immediate medical attention, even if the symptoms go away. 05 ABOUT MY STROKE Talk with your health care team to learn where in the brain your stroke happened and mark it on the image below. You can learn how stroke in different areas of the brain may affect the survivor at strokeconnection.org/about-our-brains.

      "text_content": "How to Care for Yourself after Carotid Artery Angioplasty and Stenting What is Carotid Artery Angioplasty and Stenting? This procedure is used to open the carotid artery and restore normal blood flow. A thin tube with a deflated balloon on the end is threaded through a blood vessel in your neck to the blocked artery. Once in place, the balloon is inflated to push the plaque against the artery wall and small wire mesh coil (stent) is then put into the artery to keep the artery open. Department of Neurosurgery -1- What will my hospital stay be like? After your procedure you will be admitted for evaluation and observation. You may be able to go home the next day. Your doctor will tell you more about what to expect. Our team will continue to help you recover from your procedure. When you arrive to the unit, your nurse and patient care technician will meet you. They will orient you and your family to the unit. Our Visitation Policy \u2022 Michigan Medicine welcomes the presence of loved ones. \u2022 Family members are welcome at your bedside 24 hours a day. We want you to feel supported, not only by the care we provide but by your loved one\u2019s presence as well. \u2022 \u201cFamily\u201d (for purpose of visitation) is defined by you and is usually 1 or more individuals who play a significant role in your life. Family members may be related in any way- biologically, legally or emotionally. Your family member may include a person(s) who is not legally related to you. \u2022 At times, we may ask your family members to step outside of the room if procedures or other necessary interventions need to be done. Your family will be welcomed back as soon as possible. \u2022 Visitation policy may change due to the COVID-19 pandemic When you first arrive \u2022 You may feel sleepy from the sedative given to you, but this should wear off in time. \u2022 You may be asked to stay in bed for several hours, keeping your leg or arm straight to prevent bleeding or bruising at your procedure site. \u2022 You will be asked to drink a lot of fluids to flush the contrast dye out of your system. Department of Neurosurgery How to Care for Yourself after Carotid Artery Angioplasty and Stenting -2- What type of monitoring will I need while I\u2019m here? When you arrive on the unit, heart monitoring patches will be attached to your chest. The patches will send your heart rate and rhythm to monitors located at your bedside and at the nursing station. Other care you may receive includes: \u2022 The nurses and techs will regularly check your blood pressure, heart rate and temperature. \u2022 After the procedure, you may have an ultrasound of your carotid artery. \u2022 The nursing staff will also examine you, specifically your speech and movements regularly. \u2022 Your procedure site will be checked frequently. \u2022 You may have your blood drawn for lab tests \u2022 We will measure how much you drink and urinate. We will provide a container for you to urinate into for measurement. We will also ask that you keep track of the amount of fluid that you drink and report it to your nurse or tech. \u2022 You may be weighed. \u2022 A staff member (either a nurse or tech) will enter your room to assess your needs hourly. Pain and discomfort after your procedure What kind of pain or discomfort will I feel after my procedure? You may feel slight pain at the puncture site (groin or neck). You should not feel significant discomfort anywhere else and the pain should be controllable with Ibuprofen and Acetaminophen. What can I do to help keep my pain under control? You doctor will order effective medication for you to take. Narcotics are not typically prescribed for this procedure and so you will most likely receive Ibuprofen and Acetaminophen. Your nurse will ask you about your pain regularly throughout your recovery. You shouldn\u2019t hesitate to ask for pain medication if needed. Department of Neurosurgery How to Care for Yourself after Carotid Artery Angioplasty and Stenting -3- Throughout your hospital stay, the nurses will monitor your need for pain medication. You can use the numeric pain rating scale below to measure your pain. This is a helpful tool you can use to describe how much pain you are feeling and to measure how well treatments are relieving your pain. You will be asked to rate your pain using a 0-to-10 pain scale. 0 means \u201cno pain.\u201d 10 means the \u201cworse pain possible.\u201d Why is it so important to control pain after my procedure? Having good pain control not only helps you feel more comfortable, but also helps you recover faster and may reduce your risk of developing certain complications, such as pneumonia and blood clots. If your pain is well managed, tasks such as sitting, walking, coughing, deep breathing and eating will be easier. What exercises will I do after the procedure? Exercise is an important part of the recovery process after your procedure. Below are activities you will be expected to perform during your hospital stay: \u2022 Deep breathing and Coughing Use your breathing machine (Incentive Spirometer) 10 times every hour while ",

A member of your health care team will review your medications at your history and physical visit. They will tell you which medications to stop before your procedure, and which to take on the morning of your procedure with a sip of water. How can I prepare for my hospital stay? \u2022 Review the preoperative booklet and bring it with you. Include the light blue Blood Bank form if indicated. \u2022 Assign a family member or friend as your driver; you will not be able to drive yourself home. Taking or cab or bus alone is not acceptable unless someone you know is with you. \u2022 Quit smoking and vaping! The sooner you quit before surgery, the better. People who smoke or vape up until the day of surgery are at higher risk of developing complications during and after surgery. We recommend you stop smoking 4-6 weeks before surgery. If you continue to smoke you will be more likely to have: o A longer stay in the hospital o A greater chance of needing intensive care o Increased risk of poor wound healing o Increased risk of death If you want assistance to quit smoking before surgery, ask for a referral to the MHealthy Tobacco Consultation Service or call them yourself at (734) 998-6222.

This may weaken you and further limit your ability to exercise. After surgery, you should try not to disturb the surgical site(s). Avoid rinsing, spitting, or touching the site(s) on the day of surgery. You may have a temporary healing abutment that can be felt above the gums at the surgical site: do not disturb it. WEARING YOUR PROSTHESIS Wearing your prosthesis after surgery may be necessary from an aesthetic point of view. Try to limit the amount of time you are SEDATED PATIENTS wearing your temporary; it will enhance your healing.

Do not be alarmed: the bone graft material is not being expelled. \u2022 It is important to stay hydrated following surgery. BLEEDING A small amount of bleeding or redness in the saliva is normal and expected for the first 24 hours after surgery. You can control excessive bleeding by placing a gauze pad directly on the wound and biting down with light pressure for 30 minutes. Do not drink through a straw for the first week after surgery or do any hard spitting. SWELLING Swelling is normal after surgery. To minimize swelling, apply an ice pack to the cheek next to the surgical site. In the first 36 hours after surgery, apply the ice continuously for 20 minutes on, and then 20 minutes off. DIET Avoid chewing on the implant site after surgery. Drink plenty of fluids. Avoid hot liquids or foods. Soft foods and liquids should be consumed on the day of surgery. During the healing/integration phase of the implants, hard and crunchy foods should be avoided. PAIN Take your medications as prescribed by the doctor. The local anesthetic administered during your surgery normally has a duration of about 2-8 hours. We advise you to take a planned medication within 2 hours of your surgery (before the numbness wears off). Taking the planned medication with food or water will lessen the side effects of nausea or stomach aggravation. If you were prescribed an antibiotic and are currently taking oral contraceptives, you should use an alternate method of birth control. ORAL HYGIENE It is important to keep your implant site clean, use an extra soft-bristled toothbrush around the implant site. Please refrain from using an electric toothbrush on your implant/bone graft site. If anything comes loose, please contact the office immediately. Good oral hygiene is essential to healing. No rinsing the day of surgery. The following evening, start using the Peridex rinse twice daily. Be sure to rinse for 30 seconds, and then spit it out. Nothing to eat or drink for 30 minutes after using this rinse, giving it the time it needs to work. Brush your teeth and the healing abutment(s) as usual, but be gentle initially with brushing the surgical areas.

      "text_content": "R.F. John Holtzen, DMD www.alpinesurgerymt.com Post-Operative Instructions: Wisdom Teeth Extraction After Wisdom Teeth Extraction The removal of impacted wisdom teeth is a serious surgical procedure, so post-operative care is very important. IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWING SURGERY \u2022 The gauze pad placed over the surgical area should be kept in place for an hour. After this time, if bleeding is still active, replace gauze; otherwise, discard. \u2022 Vigorous mouth rinsing and/or touching the wound area following surgery should be avoided. This may initiate bleeding by causing the blood clot that has formed to become dislodged, which can cause a dry socket. \u2022 Once numbness is gone and gauze has been discarded, try to eat something soft, avoiding anything hard, sticky, or chewy. At this point take your pain medication. NEVER TAKE ON AN EMPTY STOMACH. \u2022 Do not drive a car, ride a bike, or drink any alcoholic beverages while taking prescribed pain medications as well as the day of the surgery. BLEEDING Bleeding may continue for a short time or may persist until the next day. You could have small amounts of intermittent bleeding for up to 2 weeks. Maintain gentle pressure by biting on the gauze packs until it stops. If profuse bleeding or any other problems occur, please call. SWELLING Pain, swelling, and bruising will reach its peak at 3\u20134 days after surgery. Discoloration and tightness opening the jaw are normal post-operative events. Do not be alarmed. Maximal swelling is expected on the third and fourth day after surgery and may last for several days. Elevating the head during sleep can help minimize swelling. A sore throat or tender nose may also occur. DIET \u2022 A liquid diet is necessary until the numbness is gone, approximately 2\u20133 hours, e.g., soup, milkshake, JELL-O, coffee, tea, etc. Drink directly from the glass or use a spoon. After numbness is gone then a soft diet, e.g., macaroni and cheese, scrambled eggs, mashed potatoes, etc., chewing away from the surgical sites. \u2022 DO NOT USE A STRAW. The sucking motion, such as smoking or using a straw, can cause more bleeding or dislodge the blood clot, causing a dry socket. \u2022 You should prevent dehydration by taking fluids regularly. At least 5\u20136 glasses of liquid should be taken daily. \u2022 Your food intake will be limited for the first few days. Try not to miss any meals; you will feel better, have more strength, less discomfort, and heal faster if you continue to eat. ORAL HYGIENE Good dental hygiene is important and should be started the day after surgery. Brush your teeth well and begin rinsing with warm water with a pinch of salt added. Do this several times a day, especially after eating. This keeps the surgical site clean and free from food. R.F. John Holtzen, DMD www.alpinesurgerymt.com Post-Operative Instructions: Wisdom Teeth Extraction (Cont.) ANTIBIOTICS \u2022 If you have been placed on antibiotics, take the tablets or liquid as directed. \u2022 Antibiotics may be but not always given to help prevent infection. \u2022 Discontinue antibiotic use in the event of a rash or any other unfavorable reaction and contact our office immediately. SUTURES Sutures are sometimes placed in the area of surgery to minimize post-operative bleeding and to help healing. Most of the time the sutures or stitches used dissolve by themselves and small pieces will come out approximately 4\u20136 days following surgery. This is to be expected. FINALLY After your procedure, you may resume taking all regularly prescribed medications as ordered unless otherwise instructed by your provider. If the sinus is entered during surgery, you will be informed by the doctor or nurse. In this case, please follow instructions below also: \u2022 NO nose blowing for 1 week. \u2022 NO blowing a wind instrument for 1 week. \u2022 Take all prescribed medications as directed.

John Holtzen, DMD www.alpinesurgerymt.com Post-Operative Instructions: Dental Implants If you have any questions or concerns after your surgery, you can reach your doctor 24 hours a day by calling our office number. We should always be your first resource if you are having difficulty. If you are going to receive intravenous sedation during your procedure, you will leave the office in the care of your escort. It is important that a person be willing and able to look after you and take responsibility for you until you are adequately recovered from your anesthesia to be on your own. How long that will take varies greatly and depends entirely upon the individual. You will likely need someone with you for at least most of the day following your surgery. When you leave the office, you will have gauze in your mouth packed tightly against or adjacent to the surgical sites. It is important that you bite on the gauze firmly, keeping it undisturbed for one hour after you leave. If you move the gauze, talk, or move your mouth around, you will stimulate persistent bleeding. After an hour, remove the gauze. If you are no longer bleeding significantly, you can leave it out from this point forward. If bleeding persists, you need to repeat that process. Wad up a tight little pack of gauze, put it directly on the spot where it's bleeding, and bite down with solid pressure undisturbed for another hour. Repeat this process as needed until the bleeding has stopped. It's important to realize a tiny amount of bleeding off and on however, even for several days, is not unusual or worrisome after oral surgery. It is very important that you be cautious while you have the gauze pack in your mouth not to swallow or let the gauze pack fall back in your throat. Your mouth may be very numb for an extended period of time, and it can be difficult to know where the gauze pack is located. Be aware that falling asleep with the gauze pack in your mouth could present a choking hazard. As soon as you are able you should have something very easy to eat, like mashed potatoes or pudding. Once you have something in your stomach, you should take some of the pain medicine you were prescribed. This way, when the numbness wears off from surgery, you will already have some pain medicine in your system. It is important to note if you take pain medicine on an empty stomach, it may make you nauseated or make you vomit. It is advisable for you to maintain a relatively soft diet for 7\u201310 days following surgery. It is particularly important that you avoid small things like rice, nuts, or popcorn, as they may get lodged in the surgical site. If you have a temporary prosthesis already on your implants, you should not use this to chew food at all until the doctor tells you it is okay to do so. You should plan to generally keep food away from areas in your mouth where your implants were placed until you have your permanent teeth in place. We recommend over the several days after surgery that you keep your head elevated as much as possible, and even keeping yourself propped up slightly while you're sleeping is helpful. Also, placing ice packs on your face adjacent where the surgery was performed for several days intermittently following surgery will be helpful to reduce the amount of pain you experience. If you have had sinus grafting performed for placement of upper jaw implants, you must avoid things that may create a pressure difference between your mouth and your nose for 4 weeks. This means you must not blow your nose or do anything that creates suction in your mouth, like using a straw. You should avoid smoking or vaping for at least 1 month after surgery, and ideally quit completely. Remember, these habits will increase the potential for failure of your implant procedure. You should not start brushing your teeth again on the day of surgery, but you must start brushing your teeth again on the day following your surgery. It is important to resume good oral hygiene as soon as possible, but be careful not to disturb the area where your actual surgery was performed. Many patients also find it soothing to rinse with warm salt water several times a day. You may also be given a prescription oral rinse, which you should use as directed on the label. If you have medications prescribed by your physician that you take on a regular basis, you should resume taking these on your normal schedule. R.F. John Holtzen, DMD www.alpinesurgerymt.com Post-Operative Instructions: Dental Implants (Cont.) It is quite normal after oral surgery to have some pain, swelling of your face, and bruising on your face or neck. Sometimes these things can be quite severe, even from a very small procedure. It is also normal to experience tightness of the muscles around your jaws, which can make it very difficult to open your mouth fully.

John Holtzen, DMD www.alpinesurgerymt.com Post-Operative Instructions: Orthognathic Surgery If you have any questions or concerns after your surgery, you can reach your doctor 24 hours a day by calling our office number. We should always be your first resource if you are having difficulty. You will receive general anesthesia during your procedure as well as various pain medications immediately afterward, so when it is time for you to go home you will leave in the care of your escort. It is important that the person be willing and able to look after you and take responsibility for you until you are adequately recovered to be on your own. How long that will take varies greatly and depends entirely upon the individual. You will, however, need someone with you for up to a week following your surgery. It is important for the week following your surgery that you keep your head elevated as much as possible. If you can sleep with your upper body elevated somewhat, this will reduce the amount of swelling you experience and you will have less pain. It is also helpful to apply ice intermittently on the sides of your jaw for several days following surgery. It is best to wrap the ice pack in a thin towel and to use it for only 15 minutes at a time, alternating sides. If you leave it in one place too long, you can injure your skin. It is good to get up and move around and walk frequently. This will also reduce the amount of swelling and pain you experience. Be very careful at first, however, that you have assistance when standing up until you are certain that you are not lightheaded and are not at risk for falling. When you go home you will typically have rubber bands on your braces, which will limit your ability to open your mouth. These may be fairly tight at first and will be adjusted to get progressively lighter over about 6 weeks following your surgery. We will provide you with a syringe that will make it easier to feed yourself. You will be required to maintain a nearly liquid diet for about 6 weeks after surgery. This will progress from absolute liquids immediately following surgery to a very soft non-chewing diet over the weeks following surgery. After 6 weeks, you will be advanced back to a soft and then to a normal diet. You should resume brushing your teeth to the best of your ability on the first day following your surgery. You must very carefully only brush the surfaces of your teeth and to avoid the areas of your incisions in the fold above and below the teeth. If you do not brush your teeth, your mouth will become very inflamed and you will be at a greater risk of infection. You will be prescribed liquid pain medications and antibiotics after surgery. It is vital that you have some food in your stomach before each time you take these medications, or they may upset your stomach or make you vomit. It is important to take pain medicines as frequently as needed to keep pain under control. If you wait to take pain medicines until the pain is more intense, it can be harder to get under control. It is normal to have some light intermittent bleeding after this type of surgery, sometimes for several weeks. You may also have dark blood drain from your nose which is accumulated in your sinuses during the surgery. If you are having continuous significant bleeding, you should contact your doctor. If you have regular medications prescribed by your physician that you take on a regular basis, you should resume taking these on your normal schedule unless you are instructed otherwise. You may need to contact your prescribing physician before surgery to acquire liquid versions of your regular medications until you are able to get pills in your mouth again. It is quite normal after jaw surgery to have some pain, swelling of your face, and bruising on your face or neck. Sometimes these things can be quite severe, even for a smaller procedure. It is also normal to experience tightness of the muscles around your jaws which can make it very difficult to open your mouth fully. All of these symptoms will generally increase 4\u20135 days after surgery and then slowly start to improve. Most patients will require some degree of pain medicine for about 7\u201314 days after surgery. Some patients who have R.F. John Holtzen, DMD www.alpinesurgerymt.com Post-Operative Instructions: Orthognathic Surgery (Cont.) jaw surgery will experience very prominent swelling and nasal congestion.

This can make breathing through your nose more difficult, and patients who have rubber bands on their braces will sometimes feel very anxious from this combination of circumstances. You can use saline or Afrin nasal spray to help clear out your nose, but you must avoid blowing your nose if you\u2019ve had upper jaw surgery.

John Holtzen, DMD www.alpinesurgerymt.com Post-Operative Instructions: Tooth Extraction If you have any questions or concerns after your surgery, you can reach your doctor 24 hours a day by calling our office number. We should always be your first resource if you are having difficulty. If you are going to receive intravenous (IV) sedation during your procedure, you will leave the office in the care of your escort. It is important that the person be willing and able to look after you and take responsibility for you until you are adequately recovered from your anesthesia to be on your own. How long that will take varies greatly and depends entirely upon the individual. You will likely need someone with you for at least most of the day following your surgery. When you leave the office, you will have gauze in your mouth packed tightly against the extraction sites. It is important that you bite on the gauze firmly, keeping it undisturbed for 1 hour after you leave. If you move the gauze, talk, or move your mouth around, you will stimulate persistent bleeding. After an hour, remove the gauze. If you are no longer bleeding significantly, you can leave it out from this point forward. If bleeding persists, you need to repeat that process. Wad up a tight little pack of gauze, put it directly on the spot where it's bleeding, and bite down with solid pressure undisturbed for another hour. Repeat this process as needed until the bleeding has stopped. It's important to realize a tiny amount of bleeding off and on however, even for several days, is not unusual or worrisome after oral surgery. It is very important that you be cautious while you have the gauze pack in your mouth not to swallow or let the gauze pack fall back in your throat. Your mouth may be very numb for an extended period of time, and it can be difficult to know where the gauze pack is located. Be aware that falling asleep with the gauze pack in your mouth could present a choking hazard. As soon as you are able you should have something very easy to eat, like mashed potatoes or pudding. And then once you have something in your stomach, you should take some of the pain medicine you were prescribed. This way, when the numbness wears off from surgery, you will already have some pain medicine in your system. It is important to note if you take pain medicine on an empty stomach it may make you nauseated or make you vomit. It is advisable for you to maintain a relatively soft diet for 7\u201310 days following surgery. It is particularly important that you avoid small things like rice, nuts, or popcorn, as they may get lodged in the surgical site. We recommend over the several days after surgery that you keep your head elevated as much as possible, and even keeping yourself propped up slightly while you're sleeping is helpful. Also, placing ice packs on your face adjacent where the surgery was performed for several days intermittently following surgery will be helpful to reduce the amount of pain you experience. You should not start brushing your teeth again on the day of surgery, but you must start brushing your teeth again on the day following your surgery. It is important to resume good oral hygiene as soon as possible, but be careful not to disturb the area where your actual surgery was performed. Many patients also find it soothing to rinse with warm salt water several times a day. If you have had lower wisdom teeth extracted, you will be provided with a small irrigating syringe. Starting on the fifth day following your surgery, you should use this syringe to gently rinse out the extraction sites of your lower wisdom teeth two times per day. This should be done very gently using either room temperature water or saltwater. If you have medications prescribed by your physician that you take on a regular basis, you should resume taking these on your normal schedule. It is quite normal after oral surgery to have some pain, swelling of your face, and bruising on your face or neck. Sometimes these things can be quite severe, even from a very small procedure. It is also normal to experience tightness of the muscles around your jaws, which can make it very difficult to open your mouth fully. All of these symptoms will generally increase for 3 \u20134 days after surgery and then slowly start to improve. Most patients will require some degree of pain medicine for 7 to 10 days after surgery. R.F. John Holtzen, DMD www.alpinesurgerymt.com Post-Operative Instructions: Tooth Extraction (Cont.) Some patients will have sutures in their mouth after surgery. All of the sutures used will dissolve over time. They do not typically need to be removed, but if you notice pieces of suture hanging or starting to come out of your mouth it is OK for you to trim them carefully with a small scissor. Small amounts of intermittent bleeding may also occur from your extraction sites, even for 2\u20133 weeks after surgery.

From Professor Tara Renton, on behalf of the Faculty of Dental Surgery, Royal College of Surgeons England The Faculty of Dental Surgery welcomes the opportunity to respond to NICE\u2019s review proposal regarding its guidance on the extraction of wisdom teeth. Executive summary Based upon the critique provided below on this NICE 2014 review, we strongly disagree with the assessment that the NICE 2000 M3M Guidelines should not be revisited. In particular, we are concerned that the additional evidence published since 2000 and the evidence provided in Appendices I, II and III were not considered in this NICE assessment. We strongly recommend that NICE re appraise the need to amend the 2000 version of M3M Guidelines in the light of evidence concerning; \uf0b7 harm to patients occurring due to retention of M3Ms, \uf0b7 that surgery in younger patients has significantly less morbidity \uf0b7 and that the majority of M3Ms are removed prior to the age of 40 years This evidence is sufficient for international Guidelines (Scandinavian, German and US) to have been amended in the last 12 months. Our response takes the form of comments in italics to each paragraph of section 7 of NICE\u201fs review proposal, the \u201eSummary of evidence and implications for review\u2019 The recommendations for future research in TA1 highlighted 2 ongoing randomised controlled trials (in the United States and in Denmark) comparing prophylactic extraction of wisdom teeth with management by deliberate retention. Full information on the Danish randomised control trial remains unavailable and the review proposal in 2003 considered the information available from the conference abstract (Vondeling et al. 1999). This paragraph confuses work undertaken in Denmark with a large body of work completed by Professor Irja Venta\u201fs team in Finland. In Denmark, Professor Andreasen started a follow-up study in the early 1990s but it was never finished. The reference to the work of Vondeling et al. 1999 is in no way related to the work of Professor Irja Venta\u201fs team in Finland which is referenced in Appendix I of this response. The Finnish third molar surgery (M3M) guidelines have recently been published supporting interventional surgery as most M3Ms end up being extracted and surgery in patients aged under 25 years has considerably less risk of morbidity. At 38 years of age only 31% of wisdom teeth remain (Vent\u00e4 I1, Ylipaavalniemi P, Turtola L. Clinical outcome of third molars in adults followed during 18 years. J Oral Maxillofac Surg. 2004 Feb;62(2):182-5.). In dentate Finns the prevalence of partially erupted or erupted wisdom teeth, from ages 30 to 65 of decreases from 30 % to less than 5 % in [Suominen - Taipale L and others. Edentulousness and the number of teeth . In: Suominen \u2013 Taipale L et al. Finnish adult oral health . The Health 2000 survey. National Public Health Institute B16 / 2004 . Helsinki 2004 ; p. 65-72]. Therefore by 38 years 70% of M3Ms are missing and by the age of 65 years 95% of M3Ms are missing. On this basis the Finnish M3M guidelines recommend an interventional approach to M3M extraction to minimise risks of retention and the associated risks of surgery in older patients. A recent study reports that in 293 patients over 79 years evaluation of their DPTs revealed that 21% had one or more maxillary and mandibular M3Ms. All M3Ms were associated with disease, carious (82%), periodontal disease (67%) or in relation to cysts or tumours (2%).Vent Irja, Kylatie Eeva, Hiltumen Katja. Pathology related to third molars in elderly persons. Clinical Oral Investigations 2014 in press. The Finnish guidelines emphasise preventive removals in selected cases and this is summarised in the article: Vent\u00e4 I. How often do asymptomatic, disease-free third molars need to be removed? J Oral Maxillofac Surg 2012;70, Suppl 1:41-47. The background and references of the four selected cases for preventive removals are very well explained in the Finnish third molar guideline http://www.kaypahoito.fi/web/kh/suositukset/suositus?id=hoi50074 The English version of the guidelines have not yet been released from the technical secretaries. The Finnish M3M Guidelines are adopted as the Scandinavian group Guidelines (Norway, Sweden, Iceland, finland and Denmark). The trial based in the United States has resulted in several published papers examining the 329 patients in this trial who had at least 1 asymptomatic wisdom tooth visible. Based on these analyses, the American Association of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons (AAOMS) recommended that wisdom teeth be removed by the time the patient is a young adult in order to prevent future problems and to ensure optimal healing. However, these recommendations faced criticism and the American Association of Public Health issued ",

WHY ARE WISDOM TEETH REMOVED? Wisdom teeth are also known as third molars. The wisdom teeth usually start to erupt through the gums Wisdom teeth can be removed to prevent serious dental problems from developing. Often, they are difficult to between the ages of 17 and 25. Most people have four wisdom teeth, but you may have more or fewer. clean due to their location at the back of the mouth; wisdom teeth provide a perfect breeding ground for the Wisdom teeth serve very little purpose in today\u2019s world, but our ancestors needed them to grind up the bacteria that cause tooth decay and other oral hygiene problems. fibrous raw plants that made up much of their diet. Here are some of the most common complications caused by wisdom teeth: THE EVOLUTION AWAY FROM WISDOM TEETH \u2022 Inflammation: The soft tissue around the wisdom teeth can become painfully inflamed, due During hundreds of thousands of years of human evolution, the jaws gradually became smaller in response to infection. to changes in the human diet. This change in the shape of the jaw has led to there being less space for extra molars, and indeed many people currently have problems with their wisdom teeth due to crowding in the back \u2022 Cavities: Wisdom teeth are difficult to clean and are therefore very susceptible to cavities, which are of the mouth. difficult to treat. The decay can spread to the second molar (the tooth next to the wisdom tooth) which may then need to be extracted. Because wisdom teeth often cause pain and swelling and can sometimes become stuck (impacted) in the jaw which leads to infections, your dentist might recommend that you have your wisdom teeth removed. \u2022 Poor positioning: Adjacent teeth can shift their positions in response to the presence of wisdom teeth. Alternatively, if your wisdom teeth are not currently causing you any problems, your dentist might suggest leaving them in place and monitoring their development. This guide will give you the information you need to \u2022 Gum disease: Impacted wisdom teeth are contained within the same gum tissue that supports the make appropriate, informed decisions about managing your wisdom teeth. back molars. If this tissue becomes diseased, the molars may have to be removed, which can lead to difficulties with chewing.

By reading this guide, you will learn: TYPICAL WISDOM TEETH POSITIONS \u2022 Why wisdom teeth sometimes need to be removed \u2022 About the wisdom teeth removal procedure Wisdom teeth that have successfully broken through the soft gum tissue are described as erupted wisdom \u2022 How to care for yourself after wisdom teeth extraction teeth. However, many wisdom teeth never emerge: these are known as impacted wisdom teeth. \u2022 How to decide whether to have your wisdom teeth removed \u2022 How to choose your oral surgeon that will carry out the extraction Impacted wisdom teeth fall into two categories: soft-tissue impacted, in which the tooth is covered only by soft gum tissue, and bony impacted, in which the tooth has not completely emerged from the bone. Teeth that are completely covered by bone (full-bony impacted) are more complicated to extract than teeth that are only partly obscured by bone (partial-bony impacted). Occasionally, impacted wisdom teeth can have an unusual position, which makes surgical extraction more difficult. If you have a wisdom tooth that is impacted or malpositioned, an experienced oral surgeon will be able to advise you on the surgical techniques that can be used to extract the tooth. SYMPTOMS OF WISDOM TEETH THAT NEED TO BE EXTRACTED Many oral surgeons recommend removing wisdom teeth even if they are not currently causing any problems, as a preventative measure against possible future complications. If the wisdom teeth are not removed during early adulthood, they should be carefully monitored for signs of problems developing. The following symptoms are signs that your wisdom teeth may need to be extracted: \u2022 Swelling and pain. \u2022 Bleeding or pus that comes from the gum tissue around the back teeth. \u2022 Abscesses or cysts around the wisdom teeth. \u2022 Infection of the gum \u2018tissue, which can develop into periodontal disease or cause a fever. \u2022 Crowding of the back teeth, which may be painful.

      "text_content": "Tooth Extraction Post-Operative Instructions BLEEDING Bleeding after surgery may continue for several hours. The best way to stop bleeding is to place a folded, damp gauze over the extraction site and gently bite for 30-60 minutes. Rest quietly with your head elevated. If bleeding continues, use gauze for an additional 30 minutes. Bleeding should always be evaluated by looking directly at the surgical site. Pink or blood-tinged saliva may be seen for 2- 3 days following the surgery and does not indicate a problem. SWELLING Swelling is the body's normal reaction to surgery and healing. The swelling will not become apparent until the day following surgery and will not reach its peak for 2-3 days. After this time, the swelling should decrease but may persist for 7- 10 days. Swelling may be minimized by the immediate use of ice packs. Apply the ice packs to the outside of the face 20 minutes on and then 20 minutes off while awake for the first 24 hours. PAIN Unfortunately, most oral surgery is accompanied by some degree of discomfort. If you do not have an allergy to non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medications like Ibuprofen (Motrin, Advil) we recommend taking this prior to the local anesthetic wearing off. More severe pain may require a narcotic pain medication. Alternate Ibuprofen and the narcotic medication. First, take narcotic medication then a couple of hours later take 400 mg (2 tablets / 200mg each) of Ibuprofen. Alternate these medications as prescribed. While taking a narcotic pain medication you may not drive or operate mechanical machinery. The prescribed pain medication will make you drowsy. Once you feel like you can stop the narcotic, use Ibuprofen or Tylenol. All medications should not exceed the recommended dosage. Discomfort should subside daily. If not, please call our office. DRY SOCKETS If a dry socket occurs (loss of blood clot from socket) there is constant pain that may radiate to other areas including ear, jaw and teeth. Symptoms of a dry socket do not occur until the 3rd to 4th day postoperative. If you do not have improvement during the first few days following the procedure, call the office. A medicated dressing may be placed if medications do not resolve the discomfort. To help prevent a dry socket avoid vigorous rinsing, sucking on the wound, spitting, using a straw, smoking and exercising for 2-3 days after procedure. You may gently rinse your mouth with a dilute mouth rinse of your choice after one day. DIET While numb, patients should avoid hot liquids or foods. Patients may have applesauce, pudding or jello. Once numbness wears off patients can progress to solid foods, chewing away from the surgical sites. Patients should avoid foods like nuts, sunflower seeds, popcorn, etc., which may get lodged in the socket areas. Fainting precaution: If you suddenly sit or stand from a lying position you may become dizzy, especially if you have not eaten or have had limited fluids. Therefore, immediately following surgery, if you are lying down, make sure to sit for at least one full minute before standing. ORAL HYGIENE The best way to prevent infection and ensure healing is to keep your mouth clean. Clean your mouth thoroughly after each meal beginning the day after surgery. Use a soft bristle toothbrush and toothpaste after meals and at bedtime. Should bleeding resume after brushing, repeat the use of gauze as described above. Do not rinse your mouth the day of surgery. ACTIVITY For the first 48 hours you should rest and relax with no physical activity. After 48 hours, you may resume activity as tolerated. HEALING Bad breath is common and will disappear as healing occurs. Two to three days following surgery, white, possible hard tissue may be seen in the surgical site. This signifies normal, healing tissue. Complete healing of the extraction site may take 6-8 weeks. SUTURES/STITCHES Sutures will resorb or fall out on their own. It is normal for a suture to come out on the day of surgery. If bleeding occurs because the sutures have fallen out, bite on gauze to apply pressure as described on the first page. ANTIBIOTICS If an antibiotic is prescribed, take the tablets or liquid as directed. Take the entire prescription until gone. Antibiotics can be given to help prevent infection. Make sure to call the office if a rash or other unfavorable reaction occurs. FOODS TO DRINK AND EAT WHILE NUMB Drink: Eat: Water Applesauce Juice Jell-O Ice Chips Pudding Popsicles Yogurt Milkshake (no straw) Soft Foods When Numbness is Gone Mashed Potatoes Pasta Eggs Pancakes Creamed Cereals Soups (be careful-not too hot) Increase Diet as Tolerated",

You may experience tenderness, mild swelling or bruising to the injection site. In rare cases, prolonged numbness can occur. Please contact our office if numbness does not wear off within 48 hours of surgery. IV Sedation It is imperative that you DO NOT drive a car or operate machinery while taking medications or recovering from the general anesthesia or IV sedation. Your judgment will be impaired. You must be under direct supervision for the first 6 hours after you receive general anesthesia or IV sedation. It is normal to feel tired, forgetful, and groggy. The following instructions are designed to help you during your recovery period. Diet: After having general anesthesia, we recommend clear liquids first (such as 7-up, water, apple juice). If you continue to feel hungry, this may be followed by soft foods (such as ice cream, Jello, pudding, malts) for the first 24 hours. After the initial 24 hour period maintain a soft diet (soups, scrambled eggs, mashed potatoes, soft chicken, soft fish) for 2 \u2013 3 days and then gradually progress to solid foods as tolerated. Avoid food like popcorn, nuts, sunflower seeds, or rice. If you are a diabetic, maintain your normal diet as much as possible and follow Doctor\u2019s instructions regarding your insulin schedule. Nausea: The medications used during and after surgery may cause nausea. If nauseated, avoid milk and other dairy products and try to drink clear liquids in small quantities, until symptoms resolve. Pain medications should not be taken on an empty stomach. Fever: A low-grade fever is not uncommon after surgery. It is usually a sign of insufficient liquid intake. Please remember to drink sufficient amounts of clear liquids to keep your body hydrated. Bruising: This may occur on the arm or hand, near the site of your IV. It is very common to have minor bruises. If the arm is inflamed or tender for the first day, apply an ice pack for 30 minutes on and then off for 30 minutes. If inflammation or tenderness does not resolve on the second day, please contact our office for evaluation. Use Caution After an extraction it is crucial that a blood clot forms in the area that the tooth was extracted. Therefore, for the first 24 hours: DO NOT: rinse, spit or suck through a straw (suction will cause the clot to be pulled out.) DO NOT: drink alcohol or use mouth rinses containing alcohol (these will dissolve the clot.) DO NOT SMOKE FOR 5 DAYS AFTER EXTRACTION. Nicotine will keep tissue growth from occurring and will result in a painful condition known as dry socket. AVOID: exercise or heavy lifting (this can cause your blood clot to be pushed out.) Swelling may occur; ice packs can be used in 15 minute intervals for the first 6 hours to reduce swelling. To prevent or slow excessive bleeding, bite with light pressure on the gauze that has been placed over the extraction site, changing the gauze every 15 minutes or as needed for up to 90 minutes after leaving the office. You should wet the gauze and squeeze excess water out of it before placing it over the extraction site. Placing dry gauze over site will allow clot to dry to gauze resulting in clot removal when changing. Place a folded towel over your pillow in case of any bleeding while sleeping. If you have heavy bleeding, severe pain or continued swelling 3 to 4 days after extraction please contact our office for a short appointment to check the extraction site. If sutures (stitches) were placed, they will dissolve on their own after a couple days. If they partially dissolve and are moving around excessively because they are not tied down anymore feel free to gently grab a loose end and remove them. Impacted Teeth Removing impacted teeth is very different from extracting erupted teeth. If you had an impacted tooth removed, you will likely have these symptoms for a short time: Difficulty opening your mouth Pain while swallowing Earache on the side of you surgery If the impacted tooth was in your lower jaw, you may have numbness in your lower lip or tongue on the side where the tooth was removed. This numbness should go away, but it may last from a few days to many months. You may also have sores on your lips after surgery. Use petroleum jelly (Vaseline) on your lips until they heal. Diet For 2 days after surgery, drink liquids and eat soft foods only. Such as milkshakes, eggnog, yogurt, cooked cereals, cottage cheese, smooth soups, mashed potatoes, refried beans, ice cream, pudding, fruit smoothies and protein shakes. On day 3 after surgery, eat soft foods that do not require much chewing, such as macaroni and cheese, cooked noodles, soft-boiled, scrambled or poached eggs and soft sandwiches.

You may experience tenderness, mild swelling or bruising to the injection site. In rare cases, prolonged numbness can occur. Please contact our office if numbness does not wear off within 48 hours of surgery. Use Caution After an implant surgery it is crucial that your surgical site remains clean and unbothered. Therefore, for the first 24 hours: DO NOT: rinse, spit or suck through a straw (suction will cause the clot to be pulled out.) DO NOT: drink alcohol or use mouth rinses containing alcohol (these will dissolve the clot.) DO NOT SMOKE FOR 5 DAYS AFTER SURGERY. Nicotine will keep tissue growth from occurring and will result in increased discomfort. AVOID: exercise or heavy lifting - we want to eliminate all stress, clenching your teeth can cause pressure to your surgical site. No strenuous activity. Swelling may occur; ice packs can be used in 15 minute intervals for the first 6 hours to reduce swelling. To prevent or slow excessive bleeding, bite with light pressure on the gauze that has been placed over the implant site, changing the gauze every 15 minutes or as needed for up to 90 minutes after leaving the office. You should wet the gauze and squeeze excess water out of it before placing it over the implant site. Placing dry gauze over site will allow clot to dry to gauze resulting in clot removal when changing. Place a folded towel over your pillow in case of any bleeding while sleeping. If you have heavy bleeding, severe pain or continued swelling 3 to 4 days after surgery please contact our office for a short appointment to check the implant site. If sutures (stitches) were placed, they will dissolve on their own after a couple days. If they partially dissolve and are moving around excessively because they are not tied down anymore feel free to gently grab a loose end and remove them. Diet For 2 days after surgery, drink liquids and eat soft foods only. Such as milkshakes, eggnog, yogurt, cooked cereals, cottage cheese, smooth soups, mashed potatoes, refried beans, ice cream, pudding, fruit smoothies and protein shakes. No straws for 3 days after surgery. On day 3 after surgery, eat soft foods that do not require much chewing, such as macaroni and cheese, cooked noodles, soft-boiled, scrambled or poached eggs and soft sandwiches. Avoid tough or crunchy foods, such as pizza, rice, popcorn, and hamburger. Avoid spicy and acidic foods. Most patients may resume their normal diet 7 days after surgery Pain Management Medicines to control pain and prevent infection will be prescribed for you. It is very important that you take all medicines as recommended by your doctor. Start taking your pain medicine before the numbness wears off. Continue to take it as prescribed. The dose for pain medicine is usually 400 mg to 800 mg ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin, or generic) every 6 hours. If you have an allergy or sensitivity to ibuprofen, or have been told not to use it, you may take up to 1,000 mg acetaminophen (Tylenol or generic) every 6 hours. Follow the pain medicine instructions your doctor gave you. If we believe you may have more severe pain, we will prescribe a stronger pain medicine which you will need to buy at a pharmacy. Oral Hygiene Continue as usual. Soreness and swelling may not permit vigorous brushing of all areas, but please make every effort to clean your teeth within the bounds of comfort. If you use an electric toothbrush, feel free to use it just as you would a manual toothbrush. Brush very gently around the surgical site being careful not to loosen or remove the stitches. If you were given an irrigating syringe, start using it the fifth day after surgery to keep sockets clean. Mix one teaspoon of salt dissolved in a tall glass of warm water. Fill the syringe with the warm salt water and irrigate any open sockets gently, especially after eating. Dry Sockets Normal healing after surgery should be as follows: The first three days of surgery are usually the most uncomfortable and there is some degree of swelling and stiffness. From the third day on, gradual, steady movements should mark the remainder of your recovery course. If there is a noticeable, distinct, persistent throbbing pain in the jaw that arises after the 4th day, please call our office. We would like the opportunity to help alleviate any discomfort. Sharp Edges You may feel sharp edges near your surgical site, occasionally small slivers of bone may work themselves out during the first week or two after surgery. They are not pieces of tooth, or implant material, but if they are bothersome we will remove them. Please call the office if you are concerned.

Usually, within 45 minutes to an hour, the bleeding will subside to a trickle. After the subsidence of bleeding, you can quit using the gauze. Gentle rinsing is encouraged beginning the night of surgery. Use the Peridex (chlorhexidine) that was prescribed, as prescribed. For further oral hygiene instructions, please review the section below entitled \u201cHome Care\u201d Do not under any circumstance blow your nose for the next 4 weeks. You may sniff all you like, but no blowing. This may be longer if indicated by delayed recovery, swelling, or prolonged bleeding. Try not to sneeze. If you do have to sneeze, sneeze with your mouth open. This is also in effect for approximately 4 weeks. If you feel congested, take Sudafed or Dimetapp as directed. Use Caution After a bone graft and sinus lift surgery, it is crucial that your surgical site remains clean and unbothered. Therefore, for the first 24 hours: DO NOT rinse, spit or suck through a straw (suction will cause the clot to be pulled out.) DO NOT drink alcohol or use mouth rinses containing alcohol (these will dissolve the clot.) DO NOT SMOKE FOR 5 DAYS AFTER SURGERY. Nicotine will keep tissue growth from occurring and will result in increased discomfort. AVOID exercise or heavy lifting for 2-3 weeks, these activities increase nasal and oral pressure, which can cause pressure on your surgical site. When you do resume your exercise regimen, start with a light to moderate workout, and gradually increase your regimen over several sessions. Stop exercising if you get light-headed. Scuba diving and flying in pressurized aircraft may increase sinus pressure and should also be avoided for 2-3 weeks. Swelling may occur; ice packs can be used in 15-minute intervals for the first 6 hours to reduce swelling. To prevent or slow excessive bleeding, bite with light pressure on the gauze that has been placed over the surgical site. Be sure to wet the gauze and squeeze excess water out before placing it over the surgical site. Dry gauze may adhere to clot or sutures, which can cause damage to the surgical site. If you have heavy bleeding, severe pain, or continued swelling 3 to 4 days after surgery, please contact our office for a short appointment to check the surgical site.

Prompt and correct emergency management is essential for attaining the best outcome after this injury. The International Association of Dental Traumatology (IADT) has developed these Guidelines as a consensus statement after a comprehensive review of the dental literature and working group discussions. It represents the current best evidence and practice based on that literature search and expert opinions. Experienced researchers and clinicians from various specialties and the general dentistry community were included in the working group. In cases where the published data did not appear conclusive, recommendations were based on consensus opinions or majority decisions of the working group. They were then reviewed and approved by the members of the IADT Board of Directors. The purpose of these Guidelines is to provide clinicians with the most widely accepted and scientifically plausi- ble approaches for the immediate or urgent care of avulsed permanent teeth. The IADT does not, and cannot, guarantee favorable outcomes from adherence to the Guidelines. However, the IADT believes that their application can maximize the probability of favorable outcomes.

      "text_content": "OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY Rhinoplasty (Nasal Surgery) Postoperative Care 2 You have just had a \u201crhinoplasty\u201d (surgery on your nose). There are incisions inside your nose, and in some instances, a small incision in the tissue between your nostrils. All of the incisions (interior and exterior) have been closed with dissolving sutures. Some cartilage and bone in your nose have been carved apart, then reshaped and repositioned. There is no packing in your nose (although there may be soft splints). You have delicate tape and possibly a molded-plastic splint glued to the outside of your nose. The tape and splint hold your cartilage and bone in the new position while they heal together. They also help minimize swelling and protect your new nose. This guide provides instructions for the care of your new nose and answers questions about the healing process. Please keep these instructions for at least the next month as a reference source. Don\u2019t hesitate to call our office if you have questions. Enjoy your new nose! 3 Activities For tonight and tomorrow night, sleep on your back with your head elevated on two pillows. Sleeping in a recliner chair is ideal. If you sleep on your side, your nose will swell closed on the \u201cdown\u201d side. Continue to sleep on your back with your head slightly elevated for the next week. Neck pillows commonly used by travelers can be helpful to maintain neutral head position during the recovery period. Keep ice packs across the splint on your nose and both eyes until you go to sleep tonight and all day tomorrow. This is to prevent bruising of your eyes, minimize swelling of your nose and face, and to generally make you more comfortable. Your nose will drain some mucus and a bit of blood for the first day or two after your surgery. This is normal. We will send you home with a drip pad of gauze under your nose to absorb this drainage. Change the gauze as needed. You may be provided with some saline nose sprays to help maintain interior nasal moisture. For the first week after surgery, you may spray, sniff in, let liquid run down the back of your throat and then spit out. This will also help rinse debris from within the nose. We will clean out your nose at the first postoperative visit. Don\u2019t blow your nose for a week, but you may sniff backwards if needed. For the first week, do not lift anything over 10 pounds, bend forward with your head down, or strain in any way. Also, do not run or do any aerobic exercise that first week, however, you may walk as much as you like. After a week, you may return to all your normal activities. Please ask our staff if you have concerns regarding any specific activity. You may wear your glasses lightly resting on your splint or taped to your forehead. (Our staff will show you how to manage this.) Wear a lightweight pair of glasses. You may use your contact lenses two days after surgery. After removal of the nasal splint, you should limit the time that you wear your glasses and continue to use a lightweight pair. Do not wear plastic-framed glasses that rest all the way over the top of your nose. If you have very small \u201cfeet\u201d on your glasses resting on your nose, you may wish to ask your optician to install larger, softer \u201cfeet.\u201d You can expect some tenderness or discomfort on the sides of your nose after you\u2019ve worn your glasses for a length of time. This is normal and may last for 3-4 months. When your nose becomes tender, remove your glasses for an hour or two. Once again, please contact our staff if you have any questions regarding your glasses or contact lenses. 4 Please do not drive for 24 hours after your surgery. Until that time, it is not safe to drive because you are still affected by the medications you were given during surgery. After a day, you may drive limited amounts. Diet You may eat a normal diet after your surgery. You may find that swallowing solid foods is a bit difficult while your nose is stuffy. Your sense of smell may be reduced for the first week, but should soon return. Please drink lots of liquids to help your body recover from anesthesia and surgery. Medications You will be given a prescription for pain medications to take only if you need them. Don\u2019t take them more often than instructed, and don\u2019t take them if you aren\u2019t in pain. These pills contain a mild narcotic and may make you light- headed or nauseated. If discomfort is mild, take one or two 200 mg ibuprophen tablets every four to six hours. You should not drive while taking any of the prescribed narcotic pain medication. You will be given a prescription for antibiotic pills to be taken after surgery. Please take the medication as instructed for proper healing. Take the antibiotics until they are completely gone. You may be given cortisone (steroids) to take. This medication helps reduce swelling and discomfort. Please take exactly as the instructions are written. Resume taking all of your normal medications the day after surgery. We also suggest taking a daily multivitam",

      "text_content": "Post-Operative Instructions for Rhinoplasty There may be information here that contradicts information on the general Post-Operative Instructions sheet. Any time this occurs, follow these procedure specific instructions. If you have any questions, please call the office at (775) 284-2020. In recovery: you will have a splint taped over your nose. This will be removed at your 1 week post op visit. Initial nasal drainage is expected for about 4 hours after surgery. Change \"drip pad\" gauze under your nose as needed. Do not make these bandages tight. If You have packing in the nose; it will typically be removed by the surgeon within a few days after surgery. First night home: Restrict your general activity to bed rest for the first night, getting up only to use the restroom with help. Drink plenty of fluids to help rid your body of the anesthetics Medications: Be sure to take your medications as prescribed. Please note first 3-5 days are the toughest. Swelling and discomfort gradually increase over the first 3 days and then will gradually subside. Don\u2019t be alarmed if things feel worse before they get better (for example, day 2 you might feel better than day 4 \u2013 that\u2019s normal). Pain Medication (Percocet or Norco): Only to be used as needed for 3-5 days. Always eat something before taking Narcotic regardless of time to help prevent nausea. Narcotics may cause constipation; you should take over the counter stool softeners. Colace is a good option but if you are prone to constipation, Miralax or Milk of Magnesia might be a better choice for you. Please prophylactically start taking a stool softener as directed the night of your surgery and continue to use while on the Narcotics. After 5 days, you may switch to Tylenol and after 2 weeks you may use ibuprofen. Anti-nausea medication (Zofran or Phenergan): If you get nauseated with pain medication; take your anti-nausea medication 20 minutes before pain pill. Antibiotics (Keflex or Clindamycin): You will be instructed on when to start your antibiotics on the day of surgery. Medrol dose pack: You will be instructed on when to start this medication on the day of surgery. Complete 5 day course as directed by pharmacy.

Hygiene: May wash from the chest down making sure to keep dressings clean and dry. You may gently cleanse face around splint. When washing hair be sure to let wash and soap run back away from splint. Do not submerge incisions under water until completely healed without scabs (approx. 4-6 weeks). Position: When sleeping and resting stay on your back and keep your head elevated about 45 degrees and place a pillow under your knees for the first week. You must change your position or get up and move around every 2 hours to reduce the dangers of blood clots. Activity: Day after your surgery walk around inside every 2 hours while awake (2-5 mins). First week is mostly resting, getting good nutrition and staying hydrated. Avoid bending over to pick things up from the floor for one week, bend at the knees. If you have to sneeze, do so with an open mouth. Second week you can start to do minimal activities with periods of rest. You will be able to return to non-strenuous work approximately 1-2 weeks after surgery. First 3 weeks after surgery, NO aerobic exercise/activities that raise your heart rate or blood pressure. NO heavy lifting, pushing or pulling of 10 lbs. or more for 6 weeks. Approximately 6-8 weeks post op strenuous activity will be allowed. NO HOT or WARM compresses.

      "text_content": "Post Operative Instructions \u2013 Rhinoplasty Surgery WHAT TO EXPECT Pain Some pain can be expected after surgery. Numbness, sensitivity or discomfort may occur in the teeth, roof of the mouth or tip of the nose. Headaches may be present in the first week or, occasionally, for longer. These symptoms usually improve during the second post-operative week. Fatigue The general anaesthetic, surgery and medications may cause you to feel fatigued for some days. Blocked, runny nose, blood clots Blood-stained mucus will usually drip from your nostrils or into your throat for the first week or so and your nose will be blocked with mucus and blood clots. These symptoms will decrease over the course of the second week. Sinus rinse will help to clear your nose (see below). Sometimes, the surgeon may have placed soft plastic stents in your nose, to be removed in the office about a week later. If present, these may contribute to some nasal blockage. Using a thin film of vaseline around the nostrils, over the wound/stitches stops blood and mucous from crusting and sticking to the skin and splints. Apply it after each rinse with a cotton bud. Bleeding Some blood stained nasal discharge is common after nasal procedures. This will be seen with saline irrigations but should decrease over the course of the first 1-2 weeks. If you have any significant bleeding (brisk bleeding, lasting more than 1 minute) at any time, promptly attend your nearest public hospital Emergency Department. WHAT TO DO General care Rest at home, keep your head elevated (even when sleeping) for 3-4 nights and avoid nose-blowing or straining for 2 weeks. For the first 2 days, an ice pack placed gently over the eyes will help with swelling and bruising - use these for no more than 20min per hour whilst awake. A gauze worn under your nostrils will help to collect the discharge. Activity You should rest at home for the first week and may begin gentle walks in the second week, if you feel well. Avoid other exercise until your surgeon permits it. You will need 2 weeks off work. Do not fly until your surgeon permits it. Medications (please note these may vary between patients) a)Antibiotics: these may cause nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea or rash. b)Prednisone: may disturb sleep, increase appetite or affect mood. There is no need to take your regular Nasonex or Dymista for 2 weeks. IMPORTANT INFORMATION Attend your nearest Emergency Department for serious complications e.g bleeding or prolonged vomiting or drowsiness. Saline Nasal Rinse This should be used at least 4-6 times each day, from the day after surgery. The sachet of salt mixture (or a teaspoon of sea salt) should be emptied into the rinse bottle, about 200mls of water added and the solution shaken until the salt is dissolved. (We recommend using boiled tap water, which has cooled to a comfortable temperature). Standing over a sink, the nozzle of the bottle is then placed into one nostril and the bottle squeezed. One full bottle should be squeezed through one nostril and the process repeated on the other side. This should be done gently at first, as there will be some resistance from the blood clots in your nose. Over the week, rinses with firmer pressure will help to clear the clots from your nose. If septoplasty splints are in situ, then irrigation is more difficult and a simple saline spray (eg. FESS) may be all that can be used effectively until the splints come out. Then standard irrigation can commence. Pain Relief 1) Paracetamol (Panadol, Panamax) should be taken from the day of surgery, regularly every 6 hours, up to 4000mg daily maximal dosage. 2) In addition, you may have been prescribed any combination of: a) Celecoxib (Celebrex), once or twice daily, up to 200mg daily maximal dosage. b) Tapentadol (Palexia), which can be slow release (50mg twice daily) OR immediate release (50-100mg every 4-6 hours, up to 600mg maximum daily dosage) c) Oxycodone (Endone), taken every 4-6 hours, as prescribed, for any pain which persists despite use of the regular painkillers. Do not exceed the maximal daily dose of medications. Codeine-containing medication should not be taken on the same day as Oxycodone. Oxycodone may cause nausea, constipation or drowsiness. Celecoxib may cause stomach upset. If pain persists despite these or you have a medication side effect troubling you, contact your surgeon or see your GP. Aspirin should be avoided due to the risk of bleeding. Post-operative appointment You will need to see your surgeon in the office 1 - 2 weeks after surgery, unless otherwise arranged. At this appointment, any splints inside the nose, and the cast/tapes over the nose will be removed, and the nose gently cleaned. After this, the skin of the nose may be pimply or red. We recommend soap and water to clean it, and the skin will slowly return to normal. Frequently asked questions; 1. Can I do some work from home in the first 2 weeks after surgery?

DUBROW, M.D. Certified, The American Board of Plastic Surgery RHINOPLASTY AFTER CARE INSTRUCTIONS GENERAL INSTRUCTIONS \u2022 Elevate head of bed to 30-45 degree angle for one week. May use 3-4 pillows to achieve appropriate elevation. \u2022 During the day for the first 72 hours after surgery, apply crushed ice in an ice bag or cold compresses to eyes to minimize swelling and bruising. Do not put pressure on or wet the nasal splint. \u2022 It is normal to continue to swell after the first 48 hours. Swelling reaches its peak at 48-72 hours. \u2022 If you have pain, take the pain medication every 4-6 hours. Alcohol should not be used while you are taking a pain medication. \u2022 If you feel anxious, take the anti-anxiety medication (Valium) every 8 hours for the first 24-48 hours. \u2022 Following surgery begin with a light diet: liquids only. The next day you can begin a soft, regular diet but for 2 weeks avoid foods that require excessive lip movement such as apples, corn on the cob, etc. \u2022 You will probably have a bloody nasal discharge for 3 - 4 days and may change the drip pad under your nose as often as needed. Do not rub or blot your nose, as this will tend to irritate if. You may discard the drip pad and remove the tape on your cheeks when the drainage has stopped. \u2022 To prevent bleeding, do not sniff or blow your nose for the first 3 weeks after surgery. Try not to sneeze, but if you do, sneeze through your mouth. \u2022 The incision of your nose is sensitive to sunlight after surgery. Protect the incision line from sun exposure for 12 months. Wear a wide brim hat and/or a good sunscreen (SPF-20 or greater) with both UVA and UVB protection if you are in the sun, in water or on snow for prolonged periods. \u2022 Take pain medication with food. You will be given an anti-anxiety/muscle relaxant medication (Valium) that you may take as well to prevent aggravation of the pain cycle. When taking Valium, take it 1 \u2013 2 hours after the pain medication. \u2022 Take a stool softener with pain medication to prevent constipation (like Ducolax which is sold over-the- counter) \u2022 DO NOT SMOKE. This is very important!!! \u2022 Do not take aspirin (or products containing aspirin) or Ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin, Midol) for 3 weeks after surgery. \u2022 Remember the Five W\u2019s: o Wind: Take 10 deep breaths per hour. The most common cause of fever / elevated temperature after surgery is due to collapse of the lungs (atelectasis). In order to decrease your body temperature and expand the lungs, it is important to do this exercise. o Water: Dehydration can also cause an increase in body temperature. It is important that you remain hydrate since abdominoplasty and liposuction deplete your body of water. o Walk: Get up and walk once every hour to keep your blood moving. This is key for preventing a blood clot. o Wonder drugs: Take your pain medication as needed. If 1 tablet is not sufficient, then take 2 tablets every 4 or 6 hours (of Percocet, Vicodin, Norco). o Wound: Observe the wound for redness, heat, discharge (pus), and openings. Bathing and Cleaning: \u2022 You may shower 2 days after surgery. \u2022 While the nasal splint is on, you may have your hair washed beauty salon fashion. Take care to prevent the nasal splint from getting wet. Keep nasal splint intact and dry UNTIL removed by your doctor. \u2022 Keep the inside edges of your nostrils and any stitches clean by using a Q-tip saturated with hydrogen peroxide. This will help prevent crust from forming. You are to advance the Q-tip into the nose as far as the entire cotton tip, but no further. You will not hurt anything inside your nose as long as you are gentle in your actions. \u2022 After the nasal splint is removed, the nose can be washed gently with a mild soap and make-up can be applied. Moisturizing creams can be used if the nose is dry. \u2022 Use saline nasal spray (Ocean or Ayr Nasal Spray) 2-3 times per day beginning the 2nd day after surgery. Continue use for 1-2 weeks as needed to keep nasal passage clean and open. Exercise and Activity: \u2022 Avoid strenuous activity (INCREASING YOUR HEART RATE ABOVE 100 BEATS PER MINUTE, - i.e. aerobics, heavy lifting, and bending over) for the first 3 weeks after surgery. This includes sexual intercourse and sexual activity. \u2022 After 2 weeks you should slowly increase your activities so you will be back to normal by the end of the 3rd week. \u2022 Avoid hitting your nose for 4 weeks after surgery. Eyeglass wear: \u2022 After the splint is removed, do not wear glasses or allow anything else to rest on your nose for 8 weeks. Glasses should be taped to the forehead or worn over the nasal splint. \u2022 Contacts can be worn as soon as the swelling has decreased enough for them to be inserted. Sutures and Splints: \u00b7 \u2022 External nasal splint will be removed at your 1 week appointment. You can shower and get the splint wet prior to your appointment, as it will be easier to remove. \u2022 Internal splints (Doyle Splints) will be removed at either your 1 or 2 week appointment. \u2022 Sutures will be removed at your 1 week appo",

ROHRICH, M.D. PLASTIC SURGERY ABDOMINOPLASTY (Tummy Tuck) AFTER CARE INSTRUCTIONS \u25cf IT IS IMPORTANT TO GET OUT OF BED EARLY AND OFTEN AFTER YOUR SURGERY (WITH ASSISTANCE) TO PREVENT POSTOPERATIVE PROBLEMS. PLEASE TAKE 15-20 DEEP BREATHS PER HOUR FREQUENTLY TO KEEP YOUR LUNGS CLEAR. \u25cf It is important to walk slightly \u201cstooped over\u201d (bent at the hips) for 3-5 days to release tension on the suture line. Sleep with your hips in a flexed position. These instructions aid in the quality of your scar. \u25cf Take your pain pills, herbal supplements, and Valium/Xanax as directed for the first 2-3 days to manage your discomfort. \u25cf Keep your head elevated about 30 degrees and leave your knees slightly flexed. \u25cf Though it is impossible to get rid of gas entirely, there are strategies to reduce it. Eat and drink slowly, chew thoroughly and cut down on carbonated drinks. Avoid sugar-free gums and sugar-free candies that contain sorbitol or zylitol \u2013 both sweeteners are poorly digested. If gas is painful and persistent, call our office. \u25cf Stay on a soft diet, high in protein, for 2-3 days and avoid spicy food which can cause nausea and gas. Then you may resume a normal, high protein diet. \u25cf Keep your drainage bulbs collapsed and record time and amounts of drainage over a 24-hour period. All patients heal differently according to many factors. Dr. Rohrich will make the decision regarding drain removal and necessity of office visits. (Generally, the drains will be removed when the drainage is 30cc or less in a 24-hour period, which usually occurs in 10-14 days.) You may shower in 2-3 days; make sure someone is with you at your first shower! \u25cf Wear a binder (compression garment) continuously for 10-14 days. You can take it off to shower after 3 days. We will do the 1st dressing change in our office. \u25cf You will have a clear skin glue dressing (Dermabond) over your incision. This will protect the incision for 7-10 days. You can shower with the Dermabond on. If you have sutures, they will be removed in 10-12 days and you will wear steri-strips for 3-4 weeks. (We will provide the steri-strips.) After all sutures have been removed, begin scar treatment: for the first 6 weeks apply a small amount of Eraclea PURE HYDRATION SERUM over all incisions AM & PM. From 6 weeks to 6 months, use Eraclea INTENSTIVE REPAIR and RECONSTRUCTION CREAM over all incisions AM & PM as directed by Dr. Rohrich (see scar care instructions). These products can be purchased at both the UT Southwestern and Park Lane locations. 1 Please visit Dr. Rohrich\u2019s website at www.drrohrich.com for additional information on plastic surgery and wellness Dallas Plastic Surgery Institute: 214-821-9114 Dr. Rohrich\u2019s Cell Phone: 214-500-4870 ABDOMINOPLASTY (Tummy Tuck) AFTER CARE INSTRUCTIONS (continued) \u25cf Please call Dr. Rohrich immediately at any sign of infection which would be signaled by fever, increased pain, new redness or swelling in the abdominal area. \u25cf You may resume sexual activity in 4 weeks. For the first 10 days following surgery, raising your blood pressure (heart rate) will cause bleeding. Abdominal stress on your muscles will stretch or break the sutures if you exercise before 4 weeks. At four weeks you should consider passive or less vigorous sexual activity that will not cause abdominal movement. POST-OP \u25cf Please do not drive for 7-10 days \u25cf Do not lift anything heavier than 10 lbs for 3 weeks \u25cf It is good to walk for 15-20 minutes 6 times per day \u25cf Do not take aspirin or products containing aspirin for 3 weeks after surgery \u25cf Do not run, lift weights, play tennis, or golf for 3-4 weeks after surgery. (Keep your heart rate under 100 for 3 weeks) \u25cf You may begin swimming 4 weeks postoperatively, if healing is complete. GENERAL INSTRUCTIONS 1. Moderate swelling of your abdomen is to be expected. You may find that your clothes may not fit as easily as before. Be patient. The swelling will gradually subside and you will be back to normal in 3 to 6 months. 2. Because of the removal of tissue from your abdomen, there is a certain amount of tightness that is to be expected. This will slowly relax within 6 months. 3. If you notice some vaginal burning and itching (vaginitis) as a result of the antibiotic used during and after surgery, our office or your family physician can prescribe Diflucan. 4. Infrequently after surgery, you may have fluid in the abdomen after the drains are removed. If this happens, you will notice a fullness or sloshy feeling in your abdomen. Please contact our office so we can aspirate it easily. 5. It is important to be seen by Dr. Rohrich at 3 weeks, 6 weeks, 6 months, and 1-year post-op. 2 Please visit Dr. Rohrich\u2019s website at www.drrohrich.com for additional information on plastic surgery and wellness Dallas Plastic Surgery Institute: 214-821-9114 Dr. Rohrich\u2019s Cell Phone: 214-500-4870 ABDOMINOPLASTY (Tummy Tuck) AFTER CARE INSTRUCTIONS (continued) 6.

After surgery, it is important for you to have someone available to stay with you for the first 24-48 hours, as you will be weak and drowsy. You may require help the first few times you get out of bed. 2. It is important to get out of bed early and often after your surgery (with assistance) to prevent postoperative problems. Please take deep breaths frequently to keep your lungs clear (15-20 per hour.) Keep your head elevated about 30 degrees (two pillows) with the knees slightly flexed. 3. A light diet is best after surgery. Begin by taking liquids slowly and progress to soups or jello. You may start a regular diet the next day. 4. Please take the pain medication only if you have pain. Take it with crackers, Jell-O, etc. You will be given an anti-anxiety/muscle relaxant medication (Valium) that you may take as well to prevent aggravation of the pain cycle. 5. For the first 48 hours keep your arm movements to a minimum. Your arms should not be used to support your body or lift anything heavy. Do not push with your arms to lift yourself in bed. 6. Infrequently small drains are used to draw off any accumulating fluid after surgery. The bulb should be kept collapsed at all times. The fluid will need to be removed from the bulb twice daily or when half full. Please keep a record of what time and how much fluid is emptied from the bulb. Bring this record with you to the office appointment. Usually drains are removed 48 hours after surgery. The drains will not be removed if you have drained more than 30 cc within a 24-hour period. 7. You will have a clear skin glue dressing (Dermabond) over your incision. This will protect the incision for 7-10 days. You can shower with the Dermabond on. If you have sutures, they will be removed in 7-10 days and you will wear steri-strips for 3-4 weeks. (We will provide the steri-strips.) Apply scar cream as directed by Dr. Rohrich (see scar care instructions) to maximize wound healing. 8. DO NOT SMOKE. This is very important. 9. You may shower 24 hours after surgery. 10. You are able to wear the surgical bra, or, a non-underwire bra, at all times day and night for 4 weeks. Then you may wear a camisole, no bra, or an underwire bra. BREAST AUGMENTATION AFTER CARE INSTRUCTIONS (continued) 11. Strenuous activities and exercises are to be avoided until 3 weeks after surgery. (heart rate should stay below 100 beats per minute.) You may gradually resume normal daily activities after 48 hours being careful to avoid any activity that causes pain or discomfort. 12. Driving may be resumed when a sharp turn of the steering wheel will not cause pain; this is usually within 5-7 days. 13. Breast implant massage should start 3-5 days after surgery. An illustration is provided and the nurse or Dr. Rohrich will show you how to perform these breast exercises. The importance of the breast exercises cannot be over emphasized. They help to prevent capsular contractures and promote healing of the chest muscles. You should be committed to doing these exercises on each breast three times daily for life. 14. All incisions will be extremely sensitive to sunlight during the healing phase. Direct sun contact or tanning booths are to be avoided and use a sunscreen with SPF of 15 with UVA and UVB protection for at least 6 months. The incision scars can be massaged with the scar therapy cream (see scar care instructions.) This will promote early softening and maturation of these areas. WHAT TO EXPECT AFTER SURGERY \u25cf Sensations like numbness, sharpness, and burning are common during the healing process. These sensations may last several weeks and will gradually disappear. \u25cf Bruising and swelling are normal for 2-3 weeks. It will disappear over time. \u25cf You will initially feel like your implants are too high and too large. This will resolve over the first 4-6 weeks post operatively. *Please note If you have nausea, vomiting, rash, shortness of breath, or diarrhea after taking your medications, please call our office. If you develop a fever (oral temperature greater than 100\u00b0), redness and/or increased pain at the surgical incision sites, please call Dr. Rohrich immediately. If you have major dental work or major surgery, please notify Dr. Rohrich so he can prescribe a preoperative medication to protect your implants from possible infection. 2 Please visit Dr. Rohrich\u2019s website at www.drrohrich.com for additional information on plastic surgery and wellness.

Don\u2019t use any pillows as you want to avoid bending forward at the neck for the first 2 weeks. 2. Avoid straining of any kind for the first 5 days. When awake in bed please flex your ankles and legs up and down 4-6 times every hour. 3. Apply covered ice bags or Swiss eye masks (keep them cold or in ice) to the exposed areas of your face for the first 72 hours to reduce swelling post-operatively. 4. If you have pain or discomfort, take the pain medication every 4-6 hours. It is best to take the pain medication with crackers, jello, etc. If you do not have pain please do not take the pain medication. Do not drink alcohol while you are taking pain medication. 5. A light diet is best following surgery that day. Begin by taking liquid slowly and progress to soups or jello. You may start with a soft, regular diet the next day, high in protein. 6. You may have drains in place under the skin, after surgery (in the neck.) These will be secured and you will/can sleep in them \u2013 we will show you, but avoid pulling on them. The bulbs connected to the end of the drains should be kept compressed at all times. Instructions regarding the drains will be given to your caretaker. The drains and head dressing are usually removed within 2 days. 7. You can expect some swelling of the face and eyes after surgery. If you develop acute onset of swelling on one side of your face or neck, which is definitely more pronounced than on the other side, or if you are having pain, which is NOT relieved by the pain medication, please call Dr. Rohrich at Dallas Plastic Surgery Institute at 214-821-9114 during office hours or on his cell at 214-500-4870. 8. Avoid turning your head to either side as this will pull on the stitch lines. To turn, move your head and shoulders as a unit. 9. DO NOT SMOKE. This is very important. 10. Facial movements (smiling, talking, chewing, yawning, etc.) should be kept to a minimum for the first week. 1 Please visit Dr. Rohrich\u2019s website at www.drrohrich.com for additional information on plastic surgery and wellness. Dallas Plastic Surgery Institute: 214-821-9114 Dr. Rohrich\u2019s Cell Phone: 214-500-4870 FACE/NECK LIFT AFTER CARE INSTRUCTIONS (continued) 11. After your dressings and drains have been removed you may wash your hair with baby shampoo. Lather your hair gently using the palms of your hands and rinse thoroughly until the soap is out. It may take several washings before all the crust and ointment is out of your hair. Do not use hairspray, conditioner, gels, etc. while the stitches and clips are in place. You may start washing your face gently and use a moisturizer on your face, being careful to keep it away from the stitch lines. 12. Your hair may be dried with a blow dryer on a cool, not a hot, setting. 13. Hair coloring should be delayed until 3 weeks after surgery when healing is completed and no crust remains. 14. Normal activity can be gradually resumed after 3 weeks but strenuous activity (heart rate above 100 beats per minute and lifting objects greater than 10 pounds) should be avoided for another week. 15. The skin of your face is sensitive to sunlight after surgery. Protect your facial skin from excessive exposure to the sun for 8 weeks. Wear a wide brim hat and sunscreen (SPF 20 or greater with UVA and UVB protection) if you are in the sun for prolonged periods, or even on cloudy days for at least 6 months. GENERAL INSTRUCTIONS AND SCAR CARE: \uf0b7 Your face/neck will feel tight but not necessarily look tight (it will look natural) and there will be a feeling of numbness in these areas for several weeks to months after surgery. This is normal and will disappear over time and the feeling will return. \uf0b7 After all sutures have been removed, begin scar treatment: for the first 6 weeks apply a small amount of Eraclea PURE HYDRATION SERUM over all incisions AM & PM. From 6 weeks to 6 months, use Eraclea INTENSIVE REPAIR and RECONSTRUCTION CREAM over all incisions AM & PM as directed by Dr. Rohrich (see scar care instructions). These products can be purchased at or our office or the EpiCentre. \uf0b7 Cosmetics can be worn on the face as early as 10 days after surgery. However, eyelid or eyelash cosmetics should not be worn until 7 days after all the eyelid sutures have been removed. There may be a feeling of numbness of the eyelids that will subside. \uf0b7 Take all medications only as directed. 2 Please visit Dr. Rohrich\u2019s website at www.drrohrich.com for additional information on plastic surgery and wellness.

ROHRICH, M.D. PLASTIC SURGERY GENIOPLASTY (Chin Implant) AFTER CARE INSTRUCTIONS \uf0b7 It is important to get out of bed early and often after your surgery (with assistance) to prevent postoperative problems. Please take 15-20 deep breaths per hour frequently to keep your lungs clear. Keep your head elevated about 30 degrees (two pillows) with your knees slightly flexed. \uf0b7 After surgery elevate your head and shoulders on 2 or more pillows. Excessive facial movements (smiling, talking, chewing, yawning, etc.) should be kept to a minimum for the first week. \uf0b7 Apply ice bags (keep them cold or in ice) to your chin for the first 48 hours to reduce swelling post-operatively. \uf0b7 If you have pain or discomfort, take the pain medication every 3 to 4 hours. It is best to take the pain medication with crackers, jello, etc. If you do not have pain, please do not take the pain medication. Do not drink alcohol while taking the pain medication. The first 24-48 hours to keep the pain cycle suppressed, you may take the pain medication every 3 to 4 hours and the Xanax every 8 hours (anti-anxiety/muscle relaxant.) \uf0b7 A light diet is best after surgery.

This is very important. \uf0b7 Dr. Rohrich will prescribe Peridex for you to rinse your mouth out with. \uf0b7 Normal activity can be gradually resumed after 3 weeks but strenuous activity (heart rate above 100 beats per minute) should be avoided for another week. Strenuous activity or lifting of objects heavier than 10 lbs. should be avoided for the first 3 weeks after surgery. \uf0b7 Your incision is near where the implant was placed, either in a crease or inside the mouth at the gum/lip junction.

After surgery, it is important for you to have someone available to stay with you for the first 24-48 hours, as you will be weak and drowsy. You may require help the first few times you get out of bed. 2. It is important to be walking early and frequently, move your legs and ankles when in bed. Keep legs elevated, when in bed, for the first 2-3 days. Please don\u2019t cross your legs as this can increase the risk for blood clots. 3. Please take 15-20 deep breaths per hour, frequently to keep your lungs clear. 4. DO NOT SMOKE. This is very important. 5. A light diet is best after surgery. Begin by taking liquids slowly and progress to soups or jello. You may start a regular diet the next day. 6. Most people experience muscle soreness as opposed to sharp pains for about 5-7 days after surgery. The pain medication and muscle relaxant we have prescribed should relieve your discomfort. You may take the pain medication every 4-6 hours as needed for the first 2-3 days after the surgery. You may take the Xanax every 8 hours for the first 24/48 hours for anxiety. It is best to take pain medication with crackers, jello, etc. Do not drink alcohol while taking pain medication. 7. It is important to refrain from any strenuous activities for 3 weeks after surgery. Keep the heart rate below 100 beats per minute and do not lift objects heavier than 10 pounds. Gradually work to pre-surgical activities beginning slowly at the 2nd week and by the 3rd week you can resume all normal activity. 8. The compression garment and foam padding must be worn AT ALL TIMES for THREE WEEKS. This is to minimize scaring, promote healing and maximize your postoperative result. You may remove the garment beginning on the 3rd day before showering. 9. After 3 weeks you only need to wear the compression garment at night. Many patients continue to wear the garment for comfort. 10. Massage to the surgical sites will help increase circulation and alleviate the hardness felt underneath the skin. Massage can begin 2 weeks after surgery. Request a lymphatic massage therapist. 11. All incisions will be extremely sensitive to sunlight during the healing phase. Direct sun or tanning booths should be avoided and use a sunscreen with SPF 20 or greater (with both UVA and UVB protection) for at least 6 months. 1 Please visit Dr. Rohrich\u2019s website at www.drrohrich.com for additional information on plastic surgery and wellness. Dallas Plastic Surgery Institute: 214-821-9114 Dr. Rohrich\u2019s Cell Phone: 214-500-4870 GYNECOMASTIA (Male Breast Reduction) AFTER CARE INSTRUCTIONS (continued) WHAT TO EXPECT AFTER GYNECOMASTIA \uf0b7 Many patients say that the pain equivalent of gynecomastia is similar to having an extremely hard workout and/or skin sunburn. The pain is not sharp but more of an ache. \uf0b7 The body retains fluids in response to surgery so do not expect to see any immediate breast loss for the first 2-3 weeks. In the long run you will see more of a change in the way your clothes fit than a decrease in pounds. \uf0b7 Swelling and bruising are a normal expectation following surgery. Bruising could be apparent for as long as 3-4 months afterwards. The bruises will move down your body as they are absorbed. \uf0b7 It is normal to have an itching and/or numbness following surgery in the areas that underwent gynecomastia. This will gradually subside over the next 2-3 months. MASSAGE THERAPY Dr. Rohrich recommends lymphatic massage therapy following liposuction surgery beginning 3-4 weeks after the procedure. Prices vary based on treatment location and duration of massage therapy. Suggested therapy is 2-3 times per week for 3-4 weeks. This allows for enhanced lymph drainage and for enhanced resolution of the swelling associated with liposuction. We also recommend circular massages with Vitamin E oil and external ultrasound heat therapy as needed. It is important to be seen by Dr. Rohrich after your initial post-op checks. He will see you in follow-up appointments at 3 weeks, 6 weeks, 6 months and 1-year post-op. Call to schedule your appointments at Dallas Plastic Surgery Institute at 214-821-9114 between the hours of 8:30-5:00. IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS, PLEASE CALL DR. ROHRICH If you are a patient at one of the facilities below, please call between the hours of 8:30-5:00. If you need immediate care, please call Dr. Rohrich anytime on his cell.

      "text_content": "POSTOPERATIVE INSTRUCTIONS RHINOPLASTY GENERAL INSTRUCTIONS These instructions should be carefully read and followed. They are designed to answer the most commonly asked questions regarding postoperative care. ACTIVITY THE FIRST WEEK Limit activity sharply over the first week following surgery. You are encouraged to walk about the house, but avoid bending at the waist or picking up heavy objects. If you over-exert yourself bleeding may result. We ask that you not drive for one week following surgery. When you rest or sleep, keep your head elevated on 2-3 pillows and try to avoid turning on your side. Keep your emotions under control. It is not unusual to feel a bit depressed for a few days after surgery. This quickly passes as you begin to look and feel better. Anger or crying will only add to swelling or initiate bleeding. Restrict your diet to plenty of fluids and easily chewable foods. Hard to chew foods like steak should be avoided for one week. You may carefully clean about the nostril with a Q-tip and peroxide once a day. Immediately afterwards place a bit of antibiotic ointment in your nostrils to keep them from drying out. Swelling for at least two weeks will obstruct the nasal passages. A humidifier may help you sleep by allowing you to breathe through your mouth more comfortably. Do not blow your nose or sniff excessively as this will only irritate the healing tissues. If you sneeze, open your mouth. Also, avoid picking up babies or small children; a flailing little arm may strike your nose. You probably will bump the nose once or more during the first week. This will hurt, but cause no problem unless the force is excessive. With assistance you may bathe in a tub. Showering is allowed on the second post-op day. Cover the nasal cast so that it remains dry. It is all right to carefully wash your face with a mild soap and clean washcloth or cotton balls. Avoid cigarette smoking or even being in an area of excessive smoke as this irritates the nose tissues and impedes healing. Also avoid alcoholic beverages the first two weeks following surgery as this may increase your chance of bleeding. ACTIVITY AFTER THE FIRST WEEK It takes six weeks for the nasal bones to fully heal. Slowly begin your activity. After the first week let your body tell you how much to do. Strenuous exercises may be resumed in 5-6 weeks. Build up to this level slowly. Semi-contact sports are to be avoided for 4-6 weeks. Full swimming is allowed after six weeks. Do not let your nose become sunburned for six months after surgery or nasal injections. This may result in prolonged swelling and erythema (redness). PAIN, SWELLING, BREATHING, BRUISING The first day or two you will have some bleeding. Do not swallow the blood, as it will make you nauseated. Most patients complain more of discomfort from nasal and sinus congestion than from pain. Any pain should be controlled via the prescribed medications. After the first day, the pain may subside enough so that plain Tylenol will be sufficient. If not, give us a call. Swelling and bruising about the eyes and cheeks is variable. Swelling maximizes at about two days and subsides over the next 5-6 days. Do not worry if you have excess swelling about the eyes and cheeks. This will clear completely and not adversely affect the results. Bruising or discoloration may persist for a few days longer. Remember, all this subsides in time and has no bearing on the results. BLEEDING It is normal to have some bleeding over the first 12 hours after surgery. It may be necessary to change the gauze drip pad a dozen or so times over that period. It is normal to have a pinkish reddish discharge from your nose and throat for the first 3-4 days. This will gradually subside. If you have profuse nasal bleeding after this time, immediately lie down with your head elevated on 3-4 pillows. Iced washcloths to the back of the neck and over the eyes may help. Give us a call if these measures do not suffice. If the cast has been removed, forego the \"finger on nose exercises\" until you check with us. MEDICATIONS Avoid medications that contain aspirin or ibuprofen for 2-3 weeks after surgery. Both pain and sleeping medications are prescribed. Take them as needed. After the first 24 hours Extra Strength Tylenol may be sufficient. Remember pain and sleep medications may impair your reactions, so avoid driving or other hazardous activities for 24 hours after taking them. If the prescribed medications do not control your symptoms, please call on us. Nausea may occasionally be related to the above medications. Small amounts of clear fluid at frequent intervals may help. If this is not effective call us. Itching under the cast may occur and can be controlled by appropriate medications. INFECTION Infection is unusual after rhinoplasty but occasionally occurs with fever over 100\u00b0F. Excessive pain, and swelling with redness may signify a developing nasal infection and should be reported. Infections generally clear up quickly and ap",

Those most in need in patients who received a 1mg intracameral injection of of the operation are often those at greatest risk, such as cefuroxime at the close of cataract surgery1. the elderly. Without knowing exactly how, when or why to In the wake of these results, a growing number of centres intervene with effective prophylactic measures, virtually have adopted this method of prophylaxis, reporting even every surgeon today follows a standard of care that involves more striking effects, on occasion, than the ESCRS antisepsis and antibiotics. study itself. In parallel, scientific principles that underlie Although cataract surgery ranks among the most frequently microbial eradication in the atypical spaces of the eye have performed surgical procedures worldwide, data to define been explored. These data and scientific principles are the most effective prophylactic measures have been nearly presented in an evidence-based manner in this publication impossible to generate, given the large patient numbers of the ESCRS Guidelines for Prevention and Treatment of needed to conduct clinical trials.

Do not hesitate to take this as prescribed in order to reduce pain and enable adequate fluid intake. 2. Low-grade fever is common to have up to one week after surgery. Call us if fever is consistently higher than 101\u2070 for over 12 (twelve) hours and does not respond to Tylenol, increased fluid intake, or cool baths. 3. Ear pain is common during the recovery period. This is a \u201creferred pain\u201d from healing at the tonsil area rather than an ear infection. Pain medicine and cool packs can be used to help with this pain. 4. White or yellowish-greenish patches at the tonsil area are healing patches or scabs, not infection. THIS IS NORMAL! The scabs usually will start to come off in 5-7 days after surgery. During this time, pain may be more sever for 3-4 days. Call us if white patches occur inside the cheeks or on the tongue, as this may be a sign of thrush. A swollen uvula is also common. 5. Bleeding can occur at any time although severe bleeding is rare. If any bleeding occurs, begin sips of ice water and cold packs to the throat and call the office. If bleeding is excessive, go immediately to the nearest hospital Emergency Room. 6. Bad breath is common until the healing is complete. 7. You or your child may talk funny for a period of time. This is normal. 8. Diet should consist of liquids and soft foods. It is important to drink lots of liquids to avoid dehydration. Signs of dehydration include fever, dry mouth and absence of urine output for several hours. It is best to avoid carbonated and citrus drinks, which can irritate the throat. Also avoid foods with sharp edges such as chips, crackers, pizza crust, etc. Tonsillectomy, T&A, UPPP Surgery Post Operative Instructions 9. Recovery takes a full 2 (two) weeks and activity should be greatly reduced during this time. Children may return to school after the first week, but should not participate in gym or sports activities. 10. A humidifier may be run at night to keep throat from drying out. 11. A follow up appointment should be scheduled per your physician\u2019s instruction. 12. Call our office if persistent problems occur such as persistent cough, vomiting, or constipation due to dehydration. 13. Call during office hours for any questions or medication refills. Please note the oncall physician does not have access to your records and cannot call in pain medication refills at night or during the weekend. POST OPERATIVE DIET 1. This diet is non-irritating. The T&A diet is non-irritating to the throat. It is used following tonsillectomies and throat surgery. Cool, clear, liquid foods are given, as well as some mild milk products. Foods and beverages containing red or orange coloring are not to be given becaue they may mask hemoptysis (blood sputum). Milk and milk products provide substantial nutrition in this diet; however, these can cause excessive mucous production and may need to be limited. Avoid sharp foods like pizza, potato chips, hamburgers, etc. Refrain from eating hot foods. 2.

      "text_content": "Transforming Episode Accountability Model (TEAM) Overview Webcast December 3, 2024 >>Jen Lippy, CMS: Good afternoon, and thank you for tuning in to the Overview Webcast for the Transforming Episode Accountability Model, or TEAM, for short. We have several CMS subject matter experts on the line with us today, and we are excited to share a presentation about TEAM. Before we dive into the agenda for today's presentation, I will introduce our presenters. My name is Jen Lippy, and I'm the Deputy Director of the CMS Innovation Center's Division of Payment Models. Sacha Wolf is a Technical Advisor within the Division of Payment Models, leading TEAM. Aaron Broun is a Social Science Research Analyst within the Division of Payment Models, helping to lead TEAM\u2019s learning system efforts. In addition to listening to this recording, please don't hesitate to reach out with questions you have about the model. TEAM's email address is CMMI_TEAM@cms.hhs.gov. The email address is also provided at the end of this presentation. In today's recording, we will review several elements of TEAM, as illustrated on this slide. To support user experience, CMS has provided timestamps in the description to allow you to reference specific sections of the presentation, as needed. Please refer to the description for more information. This recording will present TEAM's purpose and participation specifications. We will identify the different episode categories tested in TEAM, and review how episodes are defined. We will also describe model overlap policies and the primary care services referral requirement. Next, we will review the quality measures and assessment process, as well as pricing and payment methodologies under TEAM. We will also go over TEAM\u2019s health equity goals. Then, we will describe the payment policy waivers, and financial arrangements available to TEAM participants. Additionally, we will describe the alternate payment model options for TEAM participants. Next, we will review TEAM\u2019s data sharing, monitoring, and evaluation requirements. We will discuss the voluntary Decarbonization and Resilience Initiative, which is the first of its kind in an Innovation Center model. Finally, we will close with a brief review of some additional resources available to TEAM participants and the public. With that, I will pass to Sacha, who will describe TEAM's purpose. Sacha, the mic is yours. >>Sacha Wolf, CMS: Thank you, Jen. I'm Sacha Wolf, and I will now review TEAM's purpose. First, we have a reminder for our listeners: All information provided in the Transforming Episode Accountability Model, or TEAM Overview, is subject to change based on future notice-and-comment rulemaking. The Fiscal Year 2025 Inpatient Prospective Payment System and Long-Term Care Hospital Prospective Payment System Final Rule contains final policies for TEAM, including the type of participant, the geographic regions required to participate, the types of episodes and quality measures in the model, how target prices are constructed, and other model policies and requirements. For your reference, we've provided a link to the final rule on this slide, and on TEAM\u2019s webpage. It's important to have a strong model purpose in order to test the outcomes that may improve quality of care and reduce Medicare spending. For TEAM, we are aware that some beneficiaries who undergo a surgical procedure in a hospital may experience fragmented care that can lead to complications, avoidable hospitalizations, and increased spending. TEAM aims to solve this issue by holding acute care hospitals accountable for quality and spending performance during a patient's hospital inpatient stay, or hospital outpatient procedure, and the 30-day period following discharge. TEAM will build on lessons learned in previous episode-based payment models to incentivize participants to coordinate care across care settings. Previous models TEAM has drawn from include the 1 Bundled Payments for Care Improvement Advanced model, or BPCI Advanced model, and the Comprehensive Care for Joint Replacement model, or CJR model. TEAM will test and evaluate the impact of a mandatory model in selected geographic areas for improved care quality and efficiency, as well as reduce healthcare costs within acute care hospitals that initiate certain surgical procedures. TEAM encourages hospitals to provide Medicare beneficiaries with coordinated, high-quality care during and after certain surgical procedures. We will highlight in an upcoming section how TEAM\u2019s pricing methodology and payment structure may help to financially incentivize high-quality, coordinated care for the episodes tested in the model. TEAM\u2019s goals are designed to drive the CMS Innovation Center's advancements in episode-based payment models and support care transformation following acute medical events. First, TEAM aims to improve the patient journey from surgery through recovery by ensuring seamless coordination and transition of care between providers, ultima",

We\u2019re putting together our Thomas F. Dodson, MD match list, and like all of you, I\u2019m thinking, no way Past-President I could match at the MGH with the current applicant pool.

In this study, we assess the feasibility of implementation, impact on patient safety, and educational benefit to residents after the program\u2019s pilot year. STUDYDESIGN: During a 1-month rotation, chief residents began cases alone using their own operative block time.Theattendingsurgeonwasnotifiedwhenthecriticalportionoftheoperationwasreached and supervised its completion. Postoperative complications, intraoperative adverse events, read- missions, operation duration, and length of stay in a subset of patients that underwent a cho- lecystectomy or appendectomy were compared with patients operated on by standard resident services. Follow-up surveys were administered to residents 1 year after graduation. RESULTS: One hundred and twenty-four operations, which ranged in complexity, were performed by chief residents. Unadjusted subset analysis comparing the structured operative autonomy (n \u00bc 54) and standard resident (n \u00bc 718) services outcomes for appendectomies and cho- lecystectomies revealed no significant differences in 30-day postoperative complications (5.6% vs 4.0%; p \u00bc 0.59), major intraoperative adverse events, or readmissions (3.7% vs 3.8%; p \u00bc 1.00), respectively. Multivariate analysis performed for 30-day complications (oddsratio0.8;95%CI0.2to3.2;p\u00bc0.76)andreadmissions(oddsratio0.4;95%CI0.1 to 2.1; p \u00bc 0.3) corroborated unadjusted findings. All participants (n \u00bc 8) strongly agreed that the rotation eased their transition to fellowship or independent practice. CONCLUSIONS: Structuredoperativeautonomyovercomesknownbarrierstograntingchiefresidentsautonomyin the operating room. When used for select general surgery cases, resident education is enhanced without impacting patient outcomes. This training model has the potential to improve the sur- gicalindependenceofgraduatingresidents. (JAmCollSurg2017;225:713e724.(cid:1)2017bythe American College of Surgeons.

The number of cesarian sections has steadily increased over past decades and the worldwide incidence is assumed to reach 30%, i.e. 38 million cesarians deliveries, by 20301. In cesarian section, a urinary catheter is used as it is considered to reduce the risk of surgical bladder injury and post-operative urinary retention. It also enables the assessment of urinary output2. However, the use of urinary catheter has also been associated with delayed ambulation, prolonged hospital stay, voiding discomfort, and urinary tract infections3. Also, the role of early post-operative mobilization is well-established. It is associated with a reduced incidence of complications like thromboembolism, and it improves pulmonary and bowel function, tissue oxygenation, and insulin resistance4,5. Also, rapid return of bowel function and decreased hospital stay are associated with early mobilization6.

        "Therefore, it is essential to consider the physiological changes of pregnancy and administer safe general anesthesia that minimizes the risks of aspiration, desaturation, failed intubation and awareness \u2013 see additional information.44, 45 16 ERC Clinical Pathway for Cesarean Delivery 4 Intraoperative Additional information \u2022 Approximately six percent of patients who undergo cesarean delivery will require general anesthesia and tracheal intubation.46 \u2022 Safe general anesthesia recommendations: \u25e6 aspiration of gastric contents is rare (two in 10,000 cases); identify risk factors and take precautions to reduce these risks (such as fasting, aspiration prophylaxis, rapid sequence induction [RSI], careful extubation and monitoring in the postoperative period) are imperative for aspiration prevention44, 45, 47 \u25e6 desaturation during RSI can be minimized by effective preoxygenation technique, gentle bag-mask ventilation, and apneic oxygenation techniques44, 45, 47 \u25e6 video laryngoscopes should be used as a first-line airway tool to maximize the success rate of intubation during RSI47, 48 \u25e6 in case of failed intubation, the use of second generation supra glottic airway device for oxygenation and ventilation is recommended48 \u25e6 if a failed airway is encountered, additional doses of induction agents should be given to reduce the risk of awareness49 Data collection \u2022 Use of neuraxial anesthesia Prevention of Spinal Anesthesia-Induced Hypotension Recommendations \u2022 To prevent spinal anesthesia-induced hypotension, baseline maternal blood pressure should be maintained with prophylactic vasopressors (for example phenylephrine or norepinephrine infusion) started immediately after injection of spinal anesthesia medications.5 Adjust the rate of infusion to keep maternal blood pressure at 90 percent or more of baseline value and avoid decreases to less than 80 percent of baseline.6 \u2022 When using phenylephrine infusion, IV ephedrine boluses should be given to manage hypotension during cesarean delivery (for example if the heart rate is low and blood pressure is <90% of baseline).6 \u2022 Crystalloid co-loading (1 L immediately and rapidly after spinal injection) is preferred over a preload, and in combination with vasopressors significantly reduces the incidence of spinal- induced hypotension.5, 6 Additional information \u2022 Vasopressor regimen may need to be modified in patients with preeclampsia as the degree of hypotension with spinal anesthesia may be less than that in non-preeclamptic patients.5 \u2022 Apply a left lateral tilt of up to 15 degrees or appropriate uterine displacement once the patient is in a supine position on the operating table to reduce maternal hypotension.6 17 ERC Clinical Pathway for Cesarean Delivery 4 Intraoperative Surgical Best Practice Bladder Catheterization Recommendation \u2022 Patients who will receive neuraxial anesthesia should have an indwelling catheter placed to prevent over-distension of the bladder.6 Intraoperative and Postoperative Nausea and Vomiting (IONV or PONV) Prophylaxis Recommendations \u2022 Prophylactic vasopressor infusion is effective in the reduction of IONV or PONV.4, 5 \u2022 Uterine exteriorization is associated with IONV.5 If this approach is used to repair the incision, a proactive antiemetic strategy should be applied to help reduce the incidence of IONV",

Masculinizing Hormone Therapy Testosterone therapy can help encourage development of facial and body hair, deepen the voice, change the shape of the face and body, and stop menstruation. Specialty Care Endocrinology Our endocrinologists are experts in overseeing hormone therapy. We can also assist with general endocrine needs including: \u2022 Weight management \u2022 Cardiovascular disease \u2022 Diabetes \u2022 Fertility \u2022 Bone health \u2022 Interaction of hormone- \u2022 Adrenal disorders therapy with other medical \u2022 Thyroid disorders treatment Gynecology Our team provides both routine and transgender and non-binary specific care. We offer hysterectomy, vaginectomy, and other gynecological proce- dures when desired. Urology Our urology team collaborates on metoidioplasty and vaginoplasty cases, assists with post-operative care for these procedures, and offers orchiectomy, or removal of the testes. The team is also available for any issues that affect genitals or urination in general. Otolaryngology and Vocal Training We offer a variety of services to help transgender and non-binary people find voice and speech patterns that are consistent with their gender identity and avoid vocal strain.

You have also been given prescriptions to help with pain and swelling. \u2022 Ice the area for the first 4-\u00ad\u20106 hours after surgery to reduce pain, swelling and bleeding. We recommend either a bag of frozen peas or an individual wrapped and frozen hot dog. DO NOT insert the hot dog; just lay it on the anal area. \u2022 Toradol (Ketorolac) 15mg #12. Take one pill every 6 hours until they are gone. These pills are for pain and swelling, you should take them even if you don\u2019t have pain to help with the swelling. If you have diabetes, kidney disease, or are taking Lisinopril or are allergic to non-\u00ad\u2010steroidal anti-\u00ad\u2010 inflammatories (NSAIDS) you will not be given this medication. \u2022 Percocet (Oxycodone/Acetaminophen) 5/500mg #28. Take 1-\u00ad\u20102 tablets every 4-\u00ad\u20106 as needed. DO NOT wait until the pain is severe before taking this medication. Take this medication with food to avoid nausea. Do not drink alcoholic beverages or drive while taking this medication. Because narcotics can cause constipation you should only use this medication if you have pain that is not relieved with Toradol, ice, and baths. If you have a pain doctor they will need to provide you the narcotic or if you are allergic to narcotics you will not be given this medication. \u2022 Lidocaine-\u00ad\u2010Prilocaine 2.5%-\u00ad\u20102.5% topical cream. Use if the pain is severe and not well controlled with the other medications. Apply around the anus or near the incision up to 4 times a day. o Dressing/Wound Care: \u2022 Keep the dressing that was placed on the wound in surgery on for the first 4 to 6 hours while you ice the area (see instructions above on ice). After this you may remove the dressing. \u2022 Do not keep removing the dressing if bloody as this just removes the clot and prevents the area from stopping the bleeding and drainage which can last up to 3 months after the procedure. \u2022 Use a mini pad, light day pad, or gauze on the area to keep it dry. \u2022 Keep the area of the surgery completely dry. Moisture and wetness will slow your recovery. If you don\u2019t have to stool don\u2019t force yourself to stool. Ideally avoid stooling the day of your surgery. 1 p: 602-\u00ad253-\u00ad4271 I f: 602-\u00ad253-\u00ad4273 6245 N 16th Street\u2022 Phoenix AZ 85016 I 20325 N 51st Ave Ste 102 \u2022Glendale AZ 85308 www.azcolorectal.com McConnell COLORECTAL CENTER seamless innovation for your wellbeing \u2022 If you need to stool you must remove the dressing. To clean after stooling you may wash the area with a shower head, as this is the best way to clean. If you are having pain after stooling or pain that will not go away despite the pain medication try local dry heat and ice alternately. \u2022 Only as a last resort for pain: Once the dressing or pad remains dry or only has a few spots of blood you may begin to take a 5 to 10 minute warm bath or sitz bath every 4 hours during the first 24 to 48 hours after surgery. This will help decrease the pain. Keep the baths short; soaking for more than 10 minutes can increase the chance of infection. If you have little or no pain do the warm baths only after stooling to keep the area clean. Remember moisture and wetness slow your recovery. \u2022 Keep the anus clean and dry, you may use a warm flow hair dryer for total drying. o Elimination: \u2022 It is important that you urinate (stooling is not a requirement) the evening of the day of surgery. DO NOT wait until your bladder feels uncomfortably full. If you cannot urinate normally, try to do so in the shower or bath tub. This will not hurt the wounds. DO NOT overhydrate yourself trying to urinate, drink only your usual amount of liquids. WHEN TO SEEK TREATMENT If you experience any of the symptoms below, call the doctor or nurse so we can determine if you will require additional treatment. If you are unable to reach either the doctor or nurse go to the nearest emergency room for evaluation. \u2022 If you have more than a cup of clotted blood from your rectum at any time \u2022 If you have not urinated within 6 hours of your procedure, even after trying the methods above. \u2022 If your pain is increasing and not responding to treatment. \u2022 If you are having fevers, chills or sweats. DAYS FOLLOWING SURGERY o Diet: \u2022 Eat a regular diet as tolerated. Remember to eat plenty of fiber (oatmeal, fresh fruits and vegetables). This will help give your stool bulk and prevent diarrhea. Diarrhea and thin stools can be as bad or worse than hard stool. \u2022 Drink plenty of water, at least 6 to 8 glasses a day (unless yo",

The goal of an ASC survey is to determine if the ASC is in compliance with the definition of an ASC, ASC general conditions and requirements, and the CfCs at 42 CFR 416 Subparts A through C. Certification of ASC compliance with the regulatory requirements is accomplished through observations, interviews, and document/record reviews. The survey process focuses on an ASC\u2019s delivery of patient care, including its organizational functions and processes for the provision of care. The ASC survey is the means used to assess compliance with Federal health, safety, and quality standards that will assure that patients receive safe, quality care, and services. Regulatory and Policy References \u2022 The Medicare definition of an ASC is found at 42 CFR 416.2 Subpart A. \u2022 General conditions and requirements for Medicare-participating ASCs are found at 42 CFR 416 Subpart B \u2022 The CfCs for ASCs are located at 42 CFR 416 Subpart C. \u2022 Survey authority and compliance regulations can be found at 42 CFR 416 Subpart B and at 42 CFR Part 488 Subpart A. \u2022 Should an individual or entity (ASC) refuse to allow immediate access upon reasonable request to either a State Agency (SA) or CMS surveyor, the Department of Health and Human Services Office of Inspector General (OIG) may exclude the ASC from participation in all Federal healthcare programs in accordance with 42 CFR 1001.1301. If a surveyor intends to make a request for immediate access with the threat of possible exclusion for non-compliance, the SA must first contact the CMS Location (formerly known as the Regional Office), which must then contact the OIG Administrative and Civil Remedies Branch at 202-619-1306. \u2022 The CMS State Operations Manual (SOM) provides CMS policy regarding survey and certification activities. All ASC surveys are unannounced. Do not provide the ASC with advance notice of the survey. Tasks in the Survey Protocol The tasks included in a survey protocol for an ASC are: Task 1 Off-Site Survey Preparation; Task 2 Entrance Activities; Task 3 Information Gathering/Investigation; Task 4 Preliminary Decision-Making and Analysis of Findings; Task 5 Exit Conference; and Task 6 Post-Survey Activities. Task 1 \u2013 Off-Site Preparation General Objectives The objectives of this task are to determine the size and composition of the survey team and to analyze information about the provider/supplier in order to identify areas of potential focus during the survey. Review of information about the ASC allows the SA (or CMS Location for Federal teams) to develop a preliminary survey plan. A full or standard survey will be conducted if the purpose of the survey is for initial certification, recertification, or validation of an accreditation organization survey. Surveys in response to a complaint or multiple complaints, or as a revisit to see if a previously cited problem has been corrected, will be focused on the CfCs related to the complaint or on the CfC for which deficiencies were previously identified. This does not preclude the scope of a complaint or revisit survey being expanded, if surveyors observe deficient practices related to other CfCs while on site. (See State Operat",

Although ICPs have been the focus of numerous publications, no guidelines have been created to standardize the management of ICPs. The aim of this article is to present the World Society of Emergency Surgery (WSES) guidelines for the management of ICP, which are intended to be used as a tool to promote global standards of care in case of ICP. These guidelines are not meant to substitute providers\u2019 clinical judgment for individual patients, and they may need to be modified based on the medical team\u2019s level of experience and the availability of local resources.

John Holtzen, DMD www.alpinesurgerymt.com Post-Operative Instructions: Wisdom Teeth Extraction After Wisdom Teeth Extraction The removal of impacted wisdom teeth is a serious surgical procedure, so post-operative care is very important. IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWING SURGERY \u2022 The gauze pad placed over the surgical area should be kept in place for an hour. After this time, if bleeding is still active, replace gauze; otherwise, discard. \u2022 Vigorous mouth rinsing and/or touching the wound area following surgery should be avoided. This may initiate bleeding by causing the blood clot that has formed to become dislodged, which can cause a dry socket. \u2022 Once numbness is gone and gauze has been discarded, try to eat something soft, avoiding anything hard, sticky, or chewy. At this point take your pain medication. NEVER TAKE ON AN EMPTY STOMACH. \u2022 Do not drive a car, ride a bike, or drink any alcoholic beverages while taking prescribed pain medications as well as the day of the surgery. BLEEDING Bleeding may continue for a short time or may persist until the next day. You could have small amounts of intermittent bleeding for up to 2 weeks. Maintain gentle pressure by biting on the gauze packs until it stops. If profuse bleeding or any other problems occur, please call. SWELLING Pain, swelling, and bruising will reach its peak at 3\u20134 days after surgery. Discoloration and tightness opening the jaw are normal post-operative events. Do not be alarmed. Maximal swelling is expected on the third and fourth day after surgery and may last for several days. Elevating the head during sleep can help minimize swelling. A sore throat or tender nose may also occur. DIET \u2022 A liquid diet is necessary until the numbness is gone, approximately 2\u20133 hours, e.g., soup, milkshake, JELL-O, coffee, tea, etc. Drink directly from the glass or use a spoon. After numbness is gone then a soft diet, e.g., macaroni and cheese, scrambled eggs, mashed potatoes, etc., chewing away from the surgical sites. \u2022 DO NOT USE A STRAW. The sucking motion, such as smoking or using a straw, can cause more bleeding or dislodge the blood clot, causing a dry socket. \u2022 You should prevent dehydration by taking fluids regularly. At least 5\u20136 glasses of liquid should be taken daily. \u2022 Your food intake will be limited for the first few days. Try not to miss any meals; you will feel better, have more strength, less discomfort, and heal faster if you continue to eat. ORAL HYGIENE Good dental hygiene is important and should be started the day after surgery. Brush your teeth well and begin rinsing with warm water with a pinch of salt added. Do this several times a day, especially after eating. This keeps the surgical site clean and free from food. R.F. John Holtzen, DMD www.alpinesurgerymt.com Post-Operative Instructions: Wisdom Teeth Extraction (Cont.) ANTIBIOTICS \u2022 If you have been placed on antibiotics, take the tablets or liquid as directed. \u2022 Antibiotics may be but not always given to help prevent infection. \u2022 Discontinue antibiotic use in the event of a rash or any other unfavorable reaction and contact our office immediately. SUTURES Sutures are sometimes placed in the area of surgery to minimize post-operative bleeding and to help healing. Most of the time the sutures or stitches used dissolve by themselves and small pieces will come out approximately 4\u20136 days following surgery. This is to be expected. FINALLY After your procedure, you may resume taking all regularly prescribed medications as ordered unless otherwise instructed by your provider. If the sinus is entered during surgery, you will be informed by the doctor or nurse. In this case, please follow instructions below also: \u2022 NO nose blowing for 1 week. \u2022 NO blowing a wind instrument for 1 week. \u2022 Take all prescribed medications as directed. If you feel air flow at the extraction site, please call. PLEASE CALL THE OFFICE IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS OR CONCERNS",

Study protocol for a cluster randomised crossover trial Jo McDonall1*, Richard de Steiger2, John Reynolds3, Bernice Redley1, Patricia Livingston4 and Mari Botti1,5 Abstract Background: Patient participation is an importantindicator ofqualitycare. Currently, there is little evidence to support thebelief that participation incare is possible for patients during the acute postoperative period. Previous work indicates that thereis very little opportunity for patients to participate incare inthe acute context. Patients require both capability, interms of having the required knowledge and understanding of how they can be involved in their care, and theopportunity, facilitated by clinicians, to engage in their acute postoperative care. Thisclusterrandomised crossover trial aims to testwhether a multimedia intervention improves patient participation in theacute postoperative context, as determinedby pain intensity and recovery outcomes. Methods/design: A total of 240patientsadmitted for primary total knee replacement surgery will be invited to participate ina cluster randomised, crossover trial and concurrent process evaluation inat least two wards at a major non-profitprivate hospital in Melbourne, Australia. Patients admitted to theinterventionward will receive the multimedia intervention daily from Day 1to Day 5(or day of discharge,if prior). The interventionwill be delivered bynursesvia an iPad, comprising informationon the goals of care for each day following surgery. Patients admitted to thecontrol ward will receive usual care as determined by care pathways currently inuse across the organization. The primary endpoint is the \u201cworst pain experienced in the past 24 h\u201don Day 3following TKR surgery. Pain intensity will be measured using thenumerical rating scale. Secondary outcomesare interference ofpain onactivities of daily living, length ofstay in hospital, function and pain following TKRsurgery, overall satisfaction withhospitalisation, postoperative complications and hospital readmission. Discussion: The results ofthis study will contribute to our understanding of theeffectiveness ofinterventions that provideknowledge and opportunity for patient participation during postoperative in-hospital care in actually increasing participation,and theimpactofparticipation on patient outcomes.The results of this study will also provide data about the barriers and enablers to participation in theacute care context.

      "text_content": "Global Veterinary Specialists Total Hip Replacement Postoperative Care Instructions After your pet undergoes a total hip replacement surgery (THR), their post-operative care is critical in terms of comfort, safety and recuperation. By carefully following the instruction listed below, you can aid healing, minimize the risk of complications or requiring additional surgery and speed recovery. These instructions are vital to ensuring your pet\u2019s comfort! Here is what you can expect: Incisional Discharge Any drainage or discharge from the incisions is not normal! If any presents itself, please contact your veterinarian or GVS. Also contact us if the incision has an unpleasant, as this could be a sign of infection. Medications It is imperative for your pet\u2019s health that you follow the medication schedule exactly and give prescribed medications for the length of time indicated. We cannot stress this enough! A plastic pill box can help you in remembering to give your pet their medications. Most medications are given to your pet the morning on their release. A pain patch is applied to your pet\u2019s skin for pain relief which may still be present during their release. If this applies to you, please do not allow the patch to become loose, or come in contact with a child. You may remove the pain patch after the first 48 hours of release. Incisions Surgical incisions need to remain dry to prevent infection from occurring. Keep checking the incision frequently for discharge or odors until it is completely healed. Otherwise, leave it alone. Do not let your pet lick their incision, as it may irritate the incision, and cause infection. Licking may also cause the stitches to be pulled out. The same holds true for biting. In case of excessive licking or biting an E-Collar may be recommended. Activity Restrictions Activity must be restricted for the first six weeks following surgery. This may be a difficult reality to live with, but it\u2019s an important one! It is particularly important to restrict your pet from running, jumping, playing, stair running, jumping up and down off furniture and walks in the neighborhood. INADEQUATE RESTRICTION OF ACTIVITY IS A COMMON CAUSE OF POST- OPERATIVE COMPLICATIONS AND INCREASED VETERINARY COSTS. Crating your pet, or keeping them in a small room, during this period may be beneficial to you. In addition, it is important for your pet to avoid slick surfaces, ensuring they don\u2019t slip. Some people find it helpful to place temporary runners in high traffic areas where tile or hardwood flooring is present. Many pets prefer to be with their people when they aren\u2019t feeling well. Some will try to follow you around the house, up and down stairs, and so on. If you use a crate to restrict activity, move the crate to the room you\u2019re going to be in so your pet doesn\u2019t feel the need to follow you around. The more normal his routine is, the happier he will be. After the first six weeks you will be asked to begin limited exercise, twice a day, beginning with short regular walks which will be determined at your pet\u2019s six week check-up. You may progressively increase the distance of your walks. These walks should last for a full-month. After this time your pet may resume normal activity. The most difficult part of the healing process is when your pet begins to feel better and wants to be active. Stand firm. It is recommended that you mark your calendar for the six-week target date of when you can lift some of your pet\u2019s activity restrictions. Some strenuous activities should be avoided for life. These include activities where your dog may jump up and land with all their weight being supported by their hind legs, such as in Frisbee. Most endurance activities, including long walks, swimming and running, do not need to be avoided once rehabilitation is complete. Follow-Up Checkups are completed at 2 weeks, 6 weeks, and annually thereafter. All sutures are removed at the two week visit. Both the six week and annual checkups will consist of an examination and radiographs. Please note that these checkups may take up to an hour of your time and that your pet may be given a sedative to ensure their comfort is maintained. You have the option of admitting your pet for the day, or making an outpatient appointment, depending on your schedule. In addition, we closely monitor all total hip replacement recipients for the duration of their life. Therefore, it is recommended that you notify us of any change in your address, and/or or phone number. Periodically, we may send short questioners to you, which ask how your pet is currently doing. We ask that you please help us by filling these out and sending them back to us. Should your pet ever need antibiotic therapy, or a dental procedure, please feel free to contact us and ask about antibiotic protocols.",

      "text_content": "www.nature.com/scientificreports OPEN The effect of video\u2011assisted discharge education after total hip replacement surgery: a randomized controlled study Ozum Cetinkaya Eren1*, Nihal Buker2, Hasan Atacan Tonak3 & Mustafa Urguden4 This study aimed to investigate the effect of a video\u2011assisted discharge education program on activities of daily living, functionality, and patient satisfaction following total hip replacement (THR) surgery. This study included 31 patients who were randomly divided into the physiotherapy group (n = 18), and the video\u2011assisted discharge education (VADE) group (n = 13). Both groups received a physiotherapy program. The VADE group was also received the VADE program. Face\u2011to\u2011 face instruction was used in all of the educational programs. There was a significant difference in favor of the VADE group in Harris Hip Score, Nottingham Extended Activities of Daily Living Scale\u2019s movement score, Tampa Scale of Kinesiophobia, Patient Satisfaction Questionnaire (p < 0.05). There was a significant difference between groups on resting pain levels in the first week and on resting and activity pain levels in the third month in favor of the VADE group (p < 0.05). The results of this study demonstrated that VADE can be effective in improving patient satisfaction and functionality, reducing pain and kinesiophobia following THR. Total Hip Replacement (THR) is a common surgical procedure performed in patients who do not respond to long-term conservative treatment to reduce high pain sensation and movement limitation in the joint1. THR affects quality of life, patient satisfaction levels, and functional losses such as muscle weakness, muscle imbal- ance problems, decreased range of motion (ROM), loss of balance, length difference in lower extremities, and deterioration in walking pattern following THR, which is widely applied all over the w orld2,3. Physiotherapy and rehabilitation routinely applied to regain functional independence in daily living, restore pain and joint range of motion, eliminate muscle weakness, regulate walking pattern, prevent falls, loosening, revision surgery and dislocations in the prosthesis, increase participation in activities of daily living (ADL), quality of life (QoL) and patient satisfaction levels after THR3,4. In patients undergoing THR surgery, recovery begins immediately after surgery and the recovery process continues over the years5. The majority of patients in this recovery process lack understanding about the activi- ties they can do following THR surgery, and they require discharge education because they are concerned about pre-discharge pain management, movement, ADL, and support requirements6,7. Discharge education is a process that starts when a patient is admitted to the hospital and prepares them for treatment, care, and rehabilitation following discharge8,9. In addition, there are pre-operative education approaches in the literature. With multidis- ciplinary pre-operative education programs, people might be less anxious, may have a shorter hospital stay, and may be better able to cope with pain3,10. Preoperative education has been found to provide patients with a more realistic expectation of surgery and has the potential to improve patient experience and satisfaction for healthcare institutions11,12. Following THR, preventive rehabilitation approaches, equipment suggestions, and home settings are used to allow people to safely perform their activities of daily living at h ome13.

      "text_content": "Discharge Instructions \u2013 Total Hip Replacement Surgery performed: Total Hip Replacement (THR) Prognosis: Your pet has a good chance to make a full recovery. Convalescent period: Weight bearing is typically seen within the first week after surgery. By two weeks after surgery most dogs are bearing a moderate amount of weight on the operated limb. By 6-8 weeks after the surgery the lameness should be resolved or greatly improved. Please give us a call if lameness is not gradually improving, or if severe lameness develops acutely on the operated limb. Diet: If your companion will not eat the regular diet, a home-made bland diet (50:50 mix of meat and carbohydrate) consisting of lean hamburger, chicken breast, lean turkey meat and a carbohydrate source such as rice, potato, or pasta) should be offered for 3 days and then wean back onto the regular diet over the next three days. Bowel movements: Your companion may not have a bowel movement for the next 4 days after surgery. If your companion does not have a bowel movement after 4 days or is straining to defecate, constipation may be present. Unflavored Metamucil at a dose of 1 teaspoon per 50 pounds body weight can be mixed in canned food (in each meal) as a laxative. If this treatment is not effective, other laxatives can be prescribed. Exercise: Use a sling that is placed under the abdomen in front of the back limbs when walking outdoors for support during the first two weeks after surgery. During icy weather conditions, the sling should be used at all times outdoors (except when your pet is posturing to eliminate). If it is not icy, remove the sling once you are outdoors so that your companion will be able to urinate. Cover all slippery floors with throw rugs or indoor/outdoor turf carpet for the first 12 weeks after surgery. Limit activity to very short leash walks for bowel and urinary purposes until the for 12 weeks. Do not leave your companion off the leash for 3 months. No jumping up and down off furniture, climbing stairs or rough-housing with other pets or people. Strenuous activity may result in severe complications. Rehabilitation therapy 1. First 3 days after surgery: a. Apply a cold compress (frozen peas, frozen corn or a cold gel pack) to the operated hip three times daily, twenty minutes each time for the next three days. Place a thin towel between the cold compress and the hip for patient comfort. 2. Day 4 to day 14: a. Apply a warm compress (warm water bottle or microwaved raw rice in a cloth bag) to the hip three times daily, ten minutes each time. Monitor the temperature of the compress so that it does not burn the skin. Place a thin towel between the warm compress and the hip for patient comfort. Follow this by gentle massaging of the muscles of the limb from bottom to top, focusing on the muscles in the front of the hip. b. Range of motion exercises should not be done. 3. Day 14 to the 12th week postop: a. As long as your pet is bearing a moderate amount of weight on the limb10 minute slow walks three times daily are permitted. b. We also recommend professional rehabilitation therapy, which can start in 4 weeks after surgery at an animal rehabilitation facility. c. A recheck and x-ray should be done at our hospital 12 weeks after surgery. Incision: A bandage covering the incision should be removed tomorrow. Daily, check the incision for signs of infection: redness, swelling, pain or discharge. Swelling of the lower part of the limb (hock) is common and will resolve within 7 to 10 days. Do not allow licking of the incision as this could cause an infection or open the incision. An Elizabethan collar should be kept on your companion for 2 weeks to prevent licking of the incision. Follow-up examinations: 1. Please make an appointment for a recheck with us in 2 weeks for an evaluation of the operated limb. 2. A recheck and x-ray should be done at our office with us in 3 months. Please fast your pet for this visit, as sedation likely will be needed. 3. On an annual basis, we recommend to examine &&PTNAME and x-ray the pelvis. IV catheter bandage: Your companion had an intravenous catheter for the administration of IV fluids during anesthesia. The catheter has been removed and a small bandage has been placed over the site (typically on the lower part of a front or hind limb) to prevent bleeding. Please remove this bandage when you arrive home. Long-term management of osteoarthritis (of other joints that may have arthritis): Recommendations to control signs of osteoarthritis include: 1. Weight management: your pet should be kept in a trim body condition 2. Do not change your pet\u2019s diet unless directed by us or your primary care veterinarian. Diets with high levels of omega fatty acids can be fed if your pet has arthritis in other joints in the body: Hill's Mobility diet or other similar prescription diet is recommended. It is important to wean your pet onto this diet over a period of 2 weeks to prevent excess flatulence and/or diarrhea. Note: if you",

The ball component is attached to the top of the femur (long bone of the thigh). The acetabulum (socket) is part of the pelvis. The ball rotating in the socket permits you to move your leg forward, backward and sideways, i.e., in all planes of motion. Pelvis Acetabulum or Socket With a healthy hip, smooth cartilage covering the ends of the thigh bone and pelvis allows the ball to glide easily inside the socket. Femur or With a problem hip, the worn cartilage no longer serves as a cushion. As the diseased or damaged bones rub together, they become rough, and the resulti",

      "text_content": "Rehabilitation Protocol for Arthroscopic Rotator Cuff Repair \u2013 Large to Massive Tears This protocol is intended to guide clinicians and patients through the post-operative course for arthroscopic rotator cuff repair surgery with large to massive sized tears. This protocol is time based (dependent on tissue healing) as well as criterion based. Specific intervention should be based on the needs of the individual and should consider exam findings and clinical decision making. If you have questions, contact the referring physician. Considerations for the Post-operative Rotator Cuff Repair Rehabilitation: Many different factors influence the post-operative rotator cuff repair rehabilitation outcome, including rotator cuff tear size, type of repair, tissue quality, number of tendons involved, and individual patient factors like age and co- morbidities, including increased BMI and diabetes. Consider taking a more conservative approach for more complex tears, and > 1 tendon involvement. Special consideration for external rotation and abduction range of motion should be taken in the case of a concomitant subscapularis repair if PROM needs to be initiated during Phase I (no ER past 0 degrees, no abduction past 90 degrees). Post-operative Complications: If the patient develops a fever, unresolving numbness/tingling, excessive drainage from the incision, uncontrolled pain or any other symptoms you have concerns about, the referring physician should be contacted. PHASE I: IMMEDIATE POST-OP: Passive Range of Motion Phase (WEEKS 1-6 AFTER SURGERY) Rehabilitation \u2022 Primary goal is to protect the tendon repair and promote tendon-to-bone healing. Goals \u2022 A 6-week period of immobilization with a sling, and delayed start of PROM is recommended for large-sized tears. \u2022 Reduce inflammation and pain. Cryotherapy and transcutaneous electrical neuromuscular stimulation help to control post-operative pain. Sling \u2022 Wear slight during the day and at night for sleeping. \u2022 Use of abduction pillow in 30-45 degrees of abduction. Precautions \u2022 Do not actively move surgical arm. \u2022 No weight bearing through surgical arm. \u2022 No passive or active range of motion of shoulder. \u2022 No reaching overhead or behind back. \u2022 No pushing and pulling. Intervention \u2022 Hand, wrist, elbow AROM (no active elbow ROM for 4 weeks if biceps tenodesis is performed). \u2022 Scapular mobility exercises with sling. Criteria to \u2022 Appropriate healing of surgical repair. Progress \u2022 Good safety adherence to precautions and immobilization guidelines. \u2022 Inflammation and pain controlled. PHASE II: INTERMEDIATE POST-OP: Passive Range of Motion (6-10 WEEKS AFTER SURGERY) Rehabilitation \u2022 Minimize post-operative stiffness while simultaneously protecting the repair. Goals \u2022 Sling can be gradually removed with surgeon\u2019s clearance. \u2022 Start passive range of motion with physical therapist at 6 weeks after surgery (pending surgeon recommendation). \u2022 Initiate home exercise program. \u2022 Reduce inflammation and pain. Cryotherapy and transcutaneous electrical neuromuscular stimulation help to control post-operative pain. \u2022 Patient education emphasizing compliance of post-operative restrictions. Sling \u2022 Sling can be gradually removed with surgeon\u2019s clearance. Precautions \u2022 No active range of motion of shoulder (AROM) despite minimal to no pain or other symptoms. \u2022 Avoid aggressive and painful passive range of motion (PROM) \u2022 No internal rotation at this time (i.e. reaching behind back). \u2022 Avoid any upper extremity weight bearing of surgical arm. Interventions Shoulder PROM \u2022 Supine passive shoulder elevation with PT or assistant o 0-100 degrees *Do not force any painful motion. \u2022 Seated Passive External Rotation with PT or assistant o 0-30 degrees \u2022 Table Slide *Avoid shoulder shrug \u2022 Shoulder Pendulums *DO NOT actively use your shoulder muscles. Strengthening \u2022 Scapular exercises (without sling) o Scapular Retraction, Scapular elevation, Scapular depression Criteria to \u2022 Appropriate healing of surgical repair. Progress \u2022 Good safety adherence to precautions. \u2022 Adequate range of motion gains determined by physical therapist and surgeon: At least 100- 120 degrees of passive forward elevation, 25-45 degrees of passive external rotation with arm at neutral, 90 degrees passive abduction. \u2022 Inflammation and pain controlled. \u2022 Compliance with home exercise program. PHASE III: Active Assisted (Weeks 10-14) and Active Range of Motion (14-18 WEEKS AFTER SURGERY) Rehabilitation \u2022 Initiate AAROM and then AROM exercises. Goals \u2022 Isometric strengthening exercises can begin 14-18 weeks after surgery. Only submaximal activation should be applied, maximal efforts can overload the repair. \u2022 Normalize motion and activities of daily living during this period. Precautions \u2022 No lifting or activities that cause pain. \u2022 No supporting of body weight by hands and arms. \u2022 No excessive behind the back movements. \u2022 No sudden or jerking motions. \u2022 No excessive loading of the healing tendon.

WOUND CARE \u2022 Maintain your operative dressing, loosen bandage if swelling of the hand occurs. \u2022 It is normal for the shoulder to bleed and swell following surgery. If blood soaks through the bandage, do not become alarmed, reinforce with additional dressing. \u2022 Remove surgical dressing on the third post-operative day \u2013 if minimal drainage is present, apply band-aids or a clean dressing over incisions and change daily. If a biceps tenodesis was performed this incision should remain dry and covered for 7 days. \u2022 To avoid infection, keep surgical incisions clean and dry \u2013 you may shower by placing a plastic covering over the surgical site beginning the day after surgery. \u2022 You can get your wound site wet in the shower on the 3rd post-operative day. o If a biceps tenodesis was performed, your wound site can get wet on the 7th post-op date. \u2022 NO immersion in a bath until given approval by our office. MEDICATIONS \u2022 Local anesthetics are injected into the wound and shoulder joint at the time of surgery. This will wear off within 8-12 hours and it is not uncommon for patients to encounter more pain on the first or second day after surgery when swelling peaks. \u2022 Most patients will require some narcotic pain medication for a short period of time \u2013 this can be taken as per directions on the bottle. \u2022 Common side effects of the pain medication are nausea, drowsiness, and constipation. To decrease the side effects take the medication with food. If constipation occurs, consider taking an over the counter laxative. \u2022 If you are having problems with nausea and vomiting, contact the office to possibly have your medications changed. \u2022 Do not drive a car or operate machinery while taking the narcotic medication or while in sling. \u2022 If you are having pain that is not being controlled by the pain medication prescribed, you may take an over the counter anti-inflammatory medication such as ibuprofen or naproxen in between doses of pain medication. This will help to decrease pain and decrease the amount of narcotic medication required. Please take as directed on the bottle. \u2022 For 2 weeks following surgery take one aspirin daily to lower the risk of developing a blood clot after surgery. Please contact the office should severe distal arm pain occur or significant swelling of the distal arm and/or hand occur. ACTIVITY \u2022 You are to wear the sling placed at surgery for a total of 4-6 weeks as described by Dr. Chahla. This includes sleeping and throughout the day. \u2022 If there are 24 hours a day, you should be in the sling 23.5 hours of the day. Removal for hygiene, dressing, and home exercise only. \u2022 When sleeping or resting, inclined positions (ie: reclining chair) and a pillow under the forearm for support may provide better comfort STILL IN SLING. \u2022 Do not engage in activities which increase pain/swelling. Unless otherwise instructed the arm should remain in the sling at all times. \u2022 Avoid long periods of sitting or long distance traveling for 2 weeks. \u2022 NO driving until instructed otherwise by physician, it is illegal to drive in a sling. \u2022 May return to sedentary work ONLY or school 3-4 days after surgery, if pain is tolerable. IMMOBILIZER (if prescribed) \u2022 Your sling with supporting pillow should be worn at all times (except for hygiene). \u2022 Keep your elbow against the pillow and in front of your body at all times to minimize stress on the repair. \u2022 Keep a pillow behind the elbow when lying down to prevent the elbow from sliding backwards. ICE THERAPY \u2022 Icing is very important in the initial post-operative period and should begin immediately after surgery. \u2022 Use icing machine continuously or ice packs (if machine not prescribed) for 45 minutes every 2 hours daily until your first post-operative visit. Care should be taken with icing to avoid frostbite to the skin. EXERCISE \u2022 Begin exercises (pendulums and flexion/extension at the elbow without resistance) 24 hours after surgery unless otherwise instructed. \u2022 While maintaining your elbow by the side, begin elbow, hand, and wrist exercises immediately. \u2022 Formal physical therapy (PT) typically begins after you are seen at your first post operative appointment 2 weeks after surgery. A prescription and protocol will be provided at your first post-op visit.

      "text_content": "BASEBALL PLAYERS GUIDE TO SHOULDER SURGERY Edward G. McFarland, M.D. Andrew J. Cosgarea, M.D. Brian J. Krabak, M.D. Johns Hopkins Sports Medicine What is the most common cause of shoulder problems in throwers? The most common symptoms a baseball player has with throwing is pain and often a decrease in performance, such a decrease in velocity. Occasionally a player may feel his shoulder feel loose or as if it is coming out of the socket, but the usual problem is just pain with throwing or after throwing. What causes the pain? The pain after throwing is typical pain of inflamed rotator cuff tendons (see Patient Guide to Rotator Cuff Tendinitis). Basically the shoulder is inflamed or irritated after throwing. The exact cause of the pain is not known, although there are several theories about what is causing the pain. The first possibility is that the tendons are seeing too much stress. This usually occurs when someone tries to get into shape too fast over too short of a period of time. The shoulder and rotator cuff tendons do not like large increases in stress whether it is early in the season or late in the season. Usually when the arm has just seen too much stress, recovery can be obtained with the usual treatments. This includes cutting back on throwing for a brief period, using ice after throwing or even a few times a day, anti- inflammatory medications and rehabilitation exercises. The rotator cuff exercises should initially be done below shoulder level and progressed to above shoulder level slowly. If the exercises hurt then you are either doing them wrong or the body is telling you something. When the cause of the pain is overuse, it seems that the recovery is never as fast as you want, and patience by the athlete and coaches is difficult. How much time is given to recovery depends upon many factors. When these treatments do not work, then other possible causes of the pain may need to be considered. The most prevalent theory is that the pain is due to the shoulder joint getting too loose. While the shoulder is not coming out of the socket, the theory is that the ligaments have become stretched to the point that the ball of the shoulder joint is sliding around too much. This puts more stress on the tendons which causes them to hurt. The shoulder is not really coming out of the socket (see Patient Guide to Shoulder Instability) but the pain is believed to be due to a hidden or occult instability. Another theory is that the pain can be due to labrum tears (see Patient Guide to Labrum Tears). The labrum is a cartilage that goes around the socket and stabilizes the shoulder. With stress over time it can become torn. Whether tears of the labrum can actually cause symptoms is controversial, since it is possible that a labral tear is an indication the joint is loose but not actually the cause of the joint being loose. How do you make the diagnosis? Determining the cause of shoulder pain in the throwing athlete is difficult for several reasons. The truth of the matter is that it is difficult to establish if the shoulder is loose or not. Studies have shown that the shoulder has a certain amount of mobility which is normal, and the problem is that it is difficult to tell upon examination of the shoulder if it is too loose or not. While some surgeons claim that they can tell, studies have shown that this examination is very subjective and probably not very reproducible among examiners. In other words, it is very difficult to push and pull on the shoulder in the office and tell if the shoulder is too loose, despite the claims of some physicians. The same problem holds true for the detection of labrum injuries in the shoulder. The physical examination of the shoulder is complex due to the muscles covering the joint. Several physicians have reported test of the shoulder that they think accurately detect labrum tears, but studies by independent observers have largely proven that these tests are not that accurate. Labrum tears do not produce a characteristic set of signs or set of pains that distinguish them from tendinitis pain. The other consideration is the use of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to make the diagnosis of instability, labrum tears or rotator cuff tears. MRIs are helpful for evaluating the rotator cuff but they are not all that great for evaluating the labrum. Our experience has been that MRIs are generally over-read by the radiologist since they have to describe everything that they see that may be abnormal; in other words, the findings are frequently not as severe as they are made to sound since MRIs are not the most accurate way to evaluate these structures in the shoulder. Sometimes the changes they see in the labrum or rotator cuff are age related changes that are not really an important part of the problem. While this is controversial, MRIs are not completely reliable for the evaluation of these structures and unless the problem is obvious, the reality is that MRI=s have significant limitations i",

      "text_content": "Post Operative Instructions Shoulder Arthroscopic SAD & Arthroscopic Rotator Cuff Repair Michael E. Joyce, MD How Big Was Your Tear??: All rotator cuff tears are different, therefore the surgical treatment of those tears are also different for each patient. After surgery I will tell you if your rotator cuff tear was small, medium or large. This is very important information since it will form the guidelines for your post- operative rehabilitation. Small tears are often repaired arthroscopically and therefore require only 2 to 4 weeks in the sling and a sooner release to full activity. Larger tears will require 6 weeks in a more restrictive sling and often 3 to 4 months of physical therapy. In addition, larger tears are much more prone to re-injury before full healing has occurred, therefore I will want you to be much more careful with your shoulder during your recovery. Bandages & Sling: Your post-operative dressing has two layers you need to understand in order to properly care for your shoulder for the two weeks following surgery. Your two or three arthroscopic incisions were closed with a single stitch, which were covered with small white tapes called Steri-Strips. Your Steri-Strips should be left in place until your sutures are removed 10 to 12 days after surgery. If you had a mini-open repair you will also have a small incision that is also closed with stitches and covered with Steri-Strips. The second layer is a large white fluffy dressing that is loosely taped to your shoulder. Since arthroscopy is performed with water, this second layer can absorb some water that will leak from your shoulder incisions for the first couple hours after surgery. Occasionally, there will also be a small amount of blood mixed with this water, which is nothing to worry about. You can remove this layer of dressing 2 days after surgery. (If there is a lot of itching, then it would be OK to remove it the day after surgery.) The sling is for both comfort and to protect your surgical repair. It should be worn in the proper position (your physical therapist will teach your how to do this), during the day and at night. Your can not go without the sling until I give you permission. Washing & Bathing: You should be careful to keep the wound clean and dry for the first 48 hours after surgery. Beginning on the fifth day after surgery it is OK to shower directly over your Steri- Strips (they won't come off). It is also OK to use soap on your shoulder and over the Steri- Strips. This shower should be quick. I would prefer that you do not take a bath until one week after surgery. After your bulky gauze dressing has been removed, large Band-Aids can be placed over the Steri-Strips. The yellow discoloration you will find on your shoulder and arm is a long lasting surgical prep called DuraPrep. This is used because it will kill bacteria on your skin hours longer than old fashion iodine surgical preps. This yellow discoloration will not come off with soap and water - instead you will need rubbing alcohol to remove it. This can be done the day after surgery unless it is causing your shoulder to itch, then it can be removed sooner. Ice & Motion: One important goal following surgery is to minimize swelling around your arm and shoulder. The best way to achieve this is with the frequent application of ice and gentle range of motion exercises. This is most important the first 48 hours following surgery, but will also be helpful after exercises and physical therapy for weeks after surgery. The ice pack should be large (like a big zip-lock bag) and held firmly on the shoulder. Immediate Post-Operative Exercises: We allow you to move your operative arm the day after surgery by performing pendulum range of motion exercises. The morning after surgery the hospital physical therapist will teach you how to do this properly. Once you are home, these motion exercises should be done every couple of hours to prevent stiffness from developing. The more stiffness that sets in - the more difficult it will be to get your motion back down the road. In fact, the sooner your shoulder function returns to normal the faster your recovery will begin. Physical Therapy Your physical therapy appointment should have been made for you before your surgery day. It is important to start physical therapy within two to three days after surgery. The goal of physical therapy is to assess how your shoulder responded to the surgical procedure, therefore they will remove your dressing and look at your wound. They will re-introduce you to your shoulder so that you feel comfortable with your surgery and aren't afraid to start doing the certain things that are safe. Your therapist will start a very specific and personalized range of motion and strength program on your first visit. They will know exactly what was done during surgery and everything they will have you do is SAFE. In addition, if they find anything unexpected they will let Dr. Joyce know right away.

      "text_content": "Rotator Cuff Patient Guide Your complete guide to recovery after rotator cuff surgery. A smoother recovery takes the right steps and support. Rotator cuff surgery has a reputation for being a long, tough process. And while it takes time, knowing what to expect and following the right plan can help get rid of your shoulder pain for good and get back to the activities you\u2019ve been missing. This guide will help you prepare for surgery and stay on track throughout your recovery. And if you need answers or support, your AHN orthopaedic and therapy teams are here for you every step of the way. First, here\u2019s a quick overview of your procedure: \u2022 During surgery, your surgeon will repair damage to your shoulder tendons and anchor them back to your arm. \u2022 Next, your surgeon will check and fix any other structures needed to give you the best chance to fully recover. \u2022 After surgery, you, your surgeon, and your physical therapist will talk through exactly what was done and make a rehab plan tailored to you and your needs. Remember, every rotator cuff repair is different. And that means every rotator cuff rehab is different. Don\u2019t compare your injury and recovery to someone else who\u2019s had rotator cuff surgery. Stick to your plan and always ask if you have questions. Speaking of questions, turn the page for some of the most common ones about rotator cuff surgery. 2 3 Frequently asked questions about rotator cuff recovery. How much pain can I expect? How will it be managed? Pain levels vary, but we treat it in a few different ways. First, we\u2019ll numb your shoulder during surgery to limit any initial pain. Then, you\u2019ll have narcotic medication for any heavy pain after surgery. You\u2019ll also use an ice pack during the first two weeks to reduce inflammation. And later, your physical therapist (PT) will use certain treatments in the clinic to help you deal with any lingering pain and soreness. Is it normal to have bruising and swelling? Yes. There\u2019s almost always some bruising or swelling after surgery. How much depends on the surgery. And sometimes gravity moves that bruising or swelling down into your arm, but that\u2019s normal too. Will I have any other soreness? You might. Some people have soreness in the top of their shoulder and the side of their neck from the sling or a change in posture. If it happens to you, let your PT know. They\u2019ll give you tips and treatments to get relief. Will I wear the sling all the time? For the most part, yes. You can expect to wear a sling for the 6 weeks after surgery. Initially, you\u2019ll be sleeping with it on too. And you\u2019ll ALWAYS wear it outside your home. Not just to protect your shoulder, but as a visual warning for others. Once you\u2019re ready, your PT will work with you on a schedule to start wearing it less and less. What if my initial bandage looks discolored or I can see blood on it? Don\u2019t worry, that\u2019s normal. If it happens, tell your surgeon\u2019s office and they\u2019ll give you instructions on how to change or reinforce it. 4 5 Frequently asked questions about rotator cuff recovery. When will I be able to drive? Not until at least 6 weeks after surgery. That\u2019s the time when you\u2019re in your sling. Keep this in mind because you\u2019ll need to arrange for rides to and from doctor and PT appointments. Your surgeon When does my initial bandage come off? will let you know exactly when it\u2019s safe to drive. Typically, 1-2 weeks after surgery. At your first post-op follow-up with your surgeon, we\u2019ll change your bandage, remove stitches, and apply Steri-Strips to keep the incisions closed while they heal. Don\u2019t use any topical antiseptics or ointments until after the Steri-Strips come off, which will happen When can I return to work? naturally in about a week. Check with your surgeon. Depending on the job, time off can range anywhere from a week for light duty work to a few months for heavy labor. You and your surgeon will make the decision to return together. Because you know best what your job takes day to day and your surgeon knows best about When can I shower? your repair and the healing process. As soon as your stitches are out. But until the Steri-Strips wear off in about a week, you shouldn\u2019t scrub the incision area. If you\u2019re in the tub, don\u2019t put the incisions under water before they\u2019re fully healed. When can I return to school? Usually, a week after surgery. But ALWAYS wear your sling throughout the school day and follow the rest of the rules for not using your arm while it recovers. Is it possible to reinjure my rotator cuff during recovery? Unfortunately, yes. The surgery uses sutures or anchors to hold your tendon in place until your body heals \u2014 which can take up to 12 weeks.

Patel, MD Shoulder Arthroscopy (Repair) Rotator Cuff Repair, SLAP & Labral Repairs, Capsulorraphy, Bicep Tenodesis Post-Operative Instructions Please bring all post-operative DME to the surgical facility the day of surgery (this includes all crutches, braces, slings, polar care machines, etc.) Diet \u2022 You may resume your regular diet. However, start slow with clear liquids and gradually work your way back to your normal diet. This will help prevent nausea and vomiting. Wound Care \u2022 Remove the dressing 72 hours after surgery. After that, you may shower. \u2022 You will have 2 to 5 small incisions around the shoulder. You may cover these incisions with band-aids after showering. \u2022 Do not put any lotions or antibiotic ointments over the incisions until they are completely closed. \u2022 Do not submerge your surgical shoulder or soak in a hot tub, swimming pool, or bath for 4 weeks. \u2022 Sutures will be removed at your first post-op visit. Drainage \u2022 It is expected you may have a fair amount of drainage into your initial post-operative dressing. This is normal and should generally become minimal to no drainage after 48- 72 hours. \u2022 Observe the area for several days noting any unusual increased drainage, unusual increase in pain, or any foul odor. \u2022 When wounds are dry, no dressing is required. Dressing can be applied per your comfort. Activities \u2022 Rest at home for the first 24 hours after surgery. \u2022 Ultrasling to be worn at all times for the first 48 hours unless directed otherwise. \u2022 After 48 hours, remove the sling for short periods 2-3 times per day to perform elbow range of motion, shoulder pendulums, and showering as instructed (see handout). Wear the ultrasling when not performing these tasks. \u2022 Physical Therapy arrangements will be made at your first follow-up appointment. Typically, outpatient therapy begins 3-6 weeks after surgery. \u2022 For rotator cuff repairs, if insurance allows, you may be set up with home health physical therapy during the initial post-operative period. This will be scheduled prior to your surgery date and will begin within 7 days after surgery. \u2022 Do not drive. Instructions will be given at you first follow-up appointment. \u2022 You may find you sleep better in a recliner although location and position is guided by your comfort. Pain Control \u2022 Take post-operative pain medicine prescribed as directed. This usually means 1 tablet every for 4 hours for mild pain or 2 tablets every 4-6 hours for severe pain. Do not take any additional Tylenol. \u2022 You can also use over-the-counter non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS) once you are eating well. They will help reduce pain, swelling, and stiffness. o Recommended: Aleve, 1 to 2 tablets every 12 hours; or Ibuprofen, 400 to 800 mg every 6 to 8 hours. Eat something prior to taking the medication. If you develop stomach burning or severe GI upset, discontinue the medication. o *Do not take NSAIDS if you have a history of kidney, liver, or stomach ulcer disease, or bleeding disorders, or if you are taking Celebrex, Bextra, or blood thinners like Coumadin. \u2022 The pain medication may also cause constipation if you take it regularly, so take the prescribed stool softner as needed. Over the counter treatments include: stool softener, fiber bar, Metamucil or prune juice to prevent constipation. \u2022 No driving while taking any narcotic pain medication. \u2022 The pain medication may cause some nausea so take it with some food. \u2022 Utilize the ice pack as instructed below Effective October 6, 2014, federal regulation prevents the ability to call or fax post-operative pain medications to pharmacies (including refills). Every prescription must be an original and presented in person; please keep this in mind when requesting additional medications. Cold Therapy \u2022 Ice should be used to help reduce pain and swelling. Use it as often as possible the first 3 days after surgery, alternating 20 minutes on with 20 minutes off. After the third day, use it at least 3 to 5 times a day for 20 minutes each session until pain and swelling have resolved. \u2022 When icing after your surgical dressing has been removed, do not put ice directly over healing skin. Use of a thin cloth barrier between the skin and ice is recommended. \u2022 Usage of an ice therapy device is at your own risk. Please make sure to read all instructions prior to purchasing one or using one. If you would like to purchase one you may do so online at Amazon.com and search \u201cCryotherapy\u201d. Nerve Blocks for Anesthesia If you had a nerve block this can last approximately 12-24 hours, sometimes longer. You may notice tingling on occasion after the block wears off. This usually resolves in several days, but if it persists please call the office. As you begin to regain your sensation take your pain medication before the block wears completely off. This will help you prevent getting behind on pain control. DVT Prevention \u2022 You must wear your white TED hose compressive stockings for 10 days after surgery. These stockings reduce swe",

Are there any patients that should be considered for an early range of motion postop operative rehab course? Many Surgeons may choose to have patients that have the following clinical situations start PT and ROM sooner to avoid the potential for post operative stiffness. - Coexisting calcific tendonitis - Coexisting adhesive capsulitis - PASTA tears - Concomitant labral repair - Acute single tendon cuff repair \uf0b7 Denard et al. Arthroscopy 2011. \uf0b7 Huberty et al. Arthroscopy 2009. \uf0b7 Koo et al. Arthroscopy 2011. \uf0b7 Oh et al. Arthroscopy 2008. - Stiffness risk minimized with early protected external rotation and an unweighted slide into forward elevation. How should I manage my surgical site, dressing and steri-strips? \uf0b7 Change your dressing every other day as needed. \uf0b7 Allow the steri-strips to fall off on their own. If necessary, sutures will be removed at your first post-operative visit. \uf0b7 You may shower with a watertight bandage in two days, but keep the incisions dry until the sutures are removed in seven to ten days.

      "text_content": "LARGE ROTATOR CUFF REPAIR PROTOCOL The intent of this protocol is to provide the clinician with instruction, direction, rehabilitative guidelines and functional goals for all rotator cuff repair procedures. It is not intended to be a substitute for clinical decision- making regarding the progression of a patient\u2019s post-operative course based on physical exam/findings and individual progress. The physiotherapist must exercise their best professional judgment to determine how to integrate this protocol into an appropriate treatment plan. The general treatment for a variety of shoulder procedures involves protection of the repair, stretching/mobilizing tight or restricted structures, strengthening the rotator cuff and strengthening and retraining the scapular musculature. This particular protocol divided into 4 phases and the timeline can vary from 4 months to 1 year: Phase 1: Passive range of motion; Phase II: Active assisted\uf0aeactive range of motion; Phase III: Resisted exercises/strengthening; Phase IV: Advanced strengthening/dynamic stability. Therefore, decisions to advance patients through the phases of rehabilitation should be based on achieving the appropriate level of soft tissue healing, as well as clinical presentation and response to treatment. As an individual\u2019s progress is variable and each will possess various pre- operative deficiencies, this protocol must be individualized for optimal return to activity. Some exercises may be adapted depending on the equipment availability at each facility. There may be slight variations in this protocol or additional restrictions placed by the surgeon post-operatively depending on findings at the time of the surgery. If a clinician requires assistance in treatment progression please contact the referring physician or the physiotherapy department. GENERAL CLASSIFICATION OF ROTATOR CUFF TEAR SIZE1 Small: <1cm in length Medium: 1-3 cm Large: 3-5 cm Massive: >5 cm Also, tears are described as either partial or full thickness depending on the amount of tissue damage. Partial tears do not go all the way through the cuff, although a large surface area may be involved either on the bursal side or, more commonly, on the articular side of the tendon(s). Full tears are completely through the tendon(s) (similar to a button-hole on a shirt) creating a gap/hole in the cuff. GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS FOR ROTATOR CUFF REPAIR 1. Quality of tissue and integrity of repair2 (stronger tissue if <50 years old). This includes the quality of the tendon, muscular tissue, and bone. Rehabilitation for the patient with good or adequate tissue would be a slightly more aggressive program, whereas the patient with poor tissue quality would follow a more conservative approach. 2. Acute vs. chronic tears/duration. Longer duration of symptoms has been correlated with histological changes in the muscle that are often progressive and irreversible and potentially increase the difficulty of repair.3 As a result, active ROM can be more difficult to achieve with chronic tears. 3. Trauma vs. degenerative tear (traumatic tears tend to have better outcomes)4 4. Tear size (large/massive tear or >1 tendon repair difficult to achieve full ROM, caution with AROM and resisted exercises with chronic/large tears). Functional outcome is directly related to size of the tear4. Therefore, the rate of progression for post-surgical rehabilitation should vary based on the size and extent of the tear. The rate of progression following rotator cuff repair surgery is often determined by the amount of retraction present prior to repair, with the more retracted tendon requiring a slower rehabilitation course because of a higher postoperative failure rate. 5. First vs. revision surgery (revisions can be more prone to fibrosis and pain)2 6. Use pain as in indicator of progression. Pain should decrease over time. 7. The early focus of physiotherapy is on achieving ROM before emphasizing strengthening. Early PROM of GH joint is essential to prevent capsular adhesions and fibrosis. This is done with muscles in a shortened position. (Supraspinatus repair: avoid passive IR, Hor Add, Ext. SubScapularis repair: avoid passive ER, Hor Add, Ext). It 1 has be shown the greatest improvement in strength recovery are during the first 6 months after surgery but to reach near-maximum strength recovery it can take up to 1 year.5, 6 Recovery of strength is correlated to tear size: a) small and medium tears strength recovery = almost complete during the first year, b) large and massive tears = much slower and less consistent.5 STRESS/STRAIN AND ROM ON HEALING ROTATOR CUFF TISSUE Tendon-to-bone healing is slow after injury/surgery as tendons have lower oxygen uptake than skeletal muscle7. It has been shown in animal studies that healing begins with the formation of a fibro-vascular tissue interface between tendon and bone.8, 9 The bone grows into the interface tissue10 and gradually, collagen fibre continuity is created between the tendon and bon",

This is done because the spine is unstable because of an injury, or because the NIAMS spine needs to be fixed in place because of pain. This surgery often includes the  NIAMS removal of part of or all of the bone that covers the back of the spinal column called the lamina. The lamina may be causing tightness around the spinal cord or nerve(s). The surgery helps to decrease the irritation or inflammation to that area. Any arthritic changes or disc material pressing on the nerve root(s) may also be removed. How long will I stay in the hospital? Most patients stay in the hospital for 2-5 days. Before you can go home, you need to be able to; 1. Control your pain by taking oral pain medications 2. Get up and walk around on your own 3. Empty your bladder. If you are unable to do these things or if you have any problems from your surgery, you may need to stay in the hospital longer. \uf0b7 A physical therapist usually helps you learn how to get in and out of bed, and use good body mechanics. \uf0b7 You may be sent home with a walker, or other home equipment, which will be determined before your discharge from the hospital. Department of Neurosurgery 734-936-7010 - 1 - Which Activities should I avoid? \uf0b7 Do not bend or twist your back repeatedly. \uf0b7 Do not lift more than 5-10 pounds (about the weight of a gallon of milk). \uf0b7 If you go to pick something up and it causes strain to the back muscles, do not lift it. \uf0b7 Remember to keep things close to your body if you do lift or carry anything, and use your knees if you bend instead of your back. \uf0b7 Do not drive for at least two weeks because of your recent surgery. After the two weeks do not drive if you are taking prescription pain medications or a muscle relaxer. These medications can cause you to be drowsy. Once you are able to drive, make sure that you can safely look over your shoulders without causing any pain. \uf0b7 Do not do any running/jogging, vacuuming, weight lifting, sweeping/mopping, laundry, shoveling/raking, riding a lawn mower, wave runner or anything that might irritate your back until you have completely healed from your surgery. \uf0b7 You may have sexual activity when you are comfortable with it. Follow these activity limitations until your follow up appointment in 4-6 weeks. How can I take care of myself at home? Please remember that it takes time for your muscles and nerves to heal. You may have complete relief of your pain immediately after your surgery, but that is not normal. Because it takes time for this healing process to occur, we ask that you not do too much to irritate your back. \uf0b7 Walk around your house at least every 1 \u00bd-2 hours while you are awake, to stay as active as possible, keep the back muscles strong, and to help prevent blood clots in your legs. \uf0b7 Once you are comfortable with walking, you can gradually increase the amount or length of time that you do walk. Department of Neurosurgery How to care for yourself after lumbar spinal fusion - 2 - \uf0b7 Do not push yourself to do too much too soon. Increasing your pain may actually delay your recovery. \uf0b7 Change your positions often. Avoid lying down, standing or sitting for long periods during the day. If you do any activity that increases your pain, you should stop it immediately. Ice: It is important to ice your back in the beginning to help with some of the swelling that occurs from surgery. \uf0b7 Place a towel over the surgical site to protect your skin, and then use a gel pack for 30 minutes, usually about 4 times per day. \uf0b7 Do not leave the pack on longer than 30 minutes since it may actually increase your pain. \uf0b7 A gel pack can be made by placing liquid dish soap in a freezer Ziploc bag until it is \u00bd to 2/3\u2019s full. Place the bag flat on a freezer shelf to allow it to harden. It will form a gel that will conform to your body. It can be refrozen after you use it. \uf0b7 Make sure to ice for 30 minutes prior to getting your staples out Washing/wound care: It is important that you wash your surgical wounds at least once per day with soap and water, and pat it dry afterward. \uf0b7 Do not be afraid of hurting the wound because of the soap and water. You should take showers, and not baths to do this. \uf0b7 Do not keep the wound covered unless you have some drainage, and were instructed by our office to do so. Which other signs and symptoms may I have? Constipation: Decreased activity after surgery, along with your pain medications, may result in constipation. It is important that you move your bowels regularly. Fruits, Department of Neurosurgery How to care for yourself after lumbar spinal fusion - 3 - bran cereal, extra fluids or over the counter laxatives such as Miralax, or Milk of Magnesia, will help you to move your bowels regularly.

      "text_content": "DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS FOLLOWING SPINAL FUSION SURGERY PHYSICAL ACTIVITY \u2022 No lifting over 5-10 pounds. \u2022 Walking is good exercise. Frequent short walks are recommended. \u2022 Avoid bending, lifting, or twisting during the first three months after surgery. \u2022 When you are able to begin lifting, bend with your knees (squat down), not your back. You will need to do this for the rest of your life. \u2022 You may climb stairs once a day for the first two weeks following surgery if tolerated. After this you may gradually increase this. \u2022 You may engage in activity, which you tolerate, that does not cause you pain at the time or the next day. \u2022 Avoid prolonged sitting. Limit sitting to 20-30 minutes at a time. \u2022 During the first two weeks following discharge from the hospital, make time for regular rest periods. Avoid sleeping on your stomach. \u2022 For comfort, use a small pillow under your knees when lying on your back or between your knees when lying on your side. \u2022 Until you resume more normal activity, work at pumping your ankles frequently (every 1-2 hours). This helps with circulation and preventing blood clots. \u2022 These are guidelines to follow. If you have questions about activity limitations after discharge, feel free to call the office. SPECIFIC FOR FUSIONS: \u2022 If you have a brace, you must wear it whenever you are out of bed. This may be for 3-6 months following surgery. Check with your doctor regarding the length of time it must be worn as this varies with each individual. \u2022 The brace does not need to be worn in the shower. However, if you are more comfortable with it on, it may be worn in the shower. Dry the brace off after your shower. Avoid bending or twisting while in the shower. \u2022 You may wear your brace next to your skin, but you will be more comfortable wearing a white tee shirt under your brace. \u2022 Your brace may be cleaned with soap and water. Do not clean it with rubbing alcohol. \u2022 Any change in your brace wear needs to be directed by your doctor. \u2022 You may have an incision on your hip area if a bone graft was taken. This needs to stay clean and dry until your staples/sutures are removed. Swelling and discoloration/bruising of this area are expected. This will gradually resolve. 2 WOUND CARE \u2022 Your dressing may be removed 2-3 days after surgery. However, if you are more comfortable keeping a dressing on your incision site, change it daily or if it becomes wet. \u2022 You may shower anytime after discharge. Sutures need to be covered prior to showering, but staples do not need to be covered. If your incision is draining, you should cover it prior to showering. After showering, gently pat the incision dry. \u2022 No tub baths. \u2022 You should have two pair of TED hose stockings for your legs. These aid in circulation following surgery and should be worn until you are walking at least 30 minutes a day and there is no swelling in your legs. The stockings may be removed twice a day for about 30 minutes each time. Apply a clean pair daily, washing the dirty pair by hand and line drying. This helps to maintain the elasticity in the stockings. Your legs need to be elevated on the bed or couch when reapplying the stockings. You will need help to reapply them. \u2022 Swelling and discoloration/bruising of your back are expected. This will gradually resolve. PRECAUTIONS Notify the office if you: \u2022 Develop a temperature greater than 100.5 that is not associated with any other illness. It is not necessary to take your temperature every day. If you feel warm, take your temperature. \u2022 Develop new or more severe pain that cannot be controlled by the pain medication. \u2022 Notice increased swelling, redness, tenderness, or warmth around your incision or you notice drainage or foul odor from your incision. \u2022 Experience changes in sensation to your legs (i.e.: numbness, tingling, etc.). Some of the symptoms you had before surgery may return after surgery as the nerve heals. Remember the source of pressure has been removed and it takes time for the nerve to heal. \u2022 Experience loss of bowel or bladder function. \u2022 Develop calf pain, chest pain, or shortness of breath. \u2022 Have any questions or problems. MEDICATIONS \u2022 A prescription for pain medication may be given to you by your doctor prior to your discharge from the hospital. These medications are used to reduce your pain and must not be taken any more often than prescribed. In an effort to keep your pain under good control, you should take the pain medications routinely as prescribed during the first 24-48 hours following surgery. Then, as the pain lessens, begin taking it as needed (within the prescribed guidelines). As you become more comfortable, you may substitute Tylenol for pain control. \u2022 Pain medication should be taken with food as this will help to prevent any stomach upset. \u2022 Requests for pain medication should be made during normal office hours. Please Note: Pain medication will only be ordered during regular office hours. \u2022 Do not drive while taking pain medications. \u2022 Do not drink alcoh",

Wound Care/Sutures. The surgical dressing will be removed before discharge from the hospital. Do not apply creams and/or cleansers to the incision. There will be dermabond glue on your skin sealing the incision. This will peel off with time. Continue changing the dressing until all drainage from the wound stops. At that time, you do not have to cover your wound. However, if your incision is sensitive or your clothing is rubbing against your wound, you may apply clean, dry gauze to cover your wound. Report immediately any signs of drainage, fever, redness, swelling around the operative incision, or severe increased pain in any one of your extremities. 2. Showers. You may begin showering as soon as you feel safe in doing so. It is alright to get the incision wet in the shower. However, do not submerge incision under water. 3. Incisional Swelling. Swelling around the incision after surgery is normal. You may even notice a slight increase in swelling after activities. This will dissipate in time; however, please report any significant swelling, redness, fever, drainage or intractable pain! 4. Post-Operative Blues. So you\u2019re feeling better and the discomfort you\u2019re in now is nothing compared to what you endured before surgery \u2026 or perhaps you feel quite the opposite. Many patients have verbalized frustration at not being able to resume normal activities \u2013 for example, driving, going back to work or participating in simple activities of daily living. Having to limit and curtail your activities, along with pain and discomfort, can leave you with the impression that you will never get better. There is a light at the end of the tunnel! Remember that your body needs to recover from major surgery. How you take care of yourself in the post-operative period will have direct bearing on the ultimate result. This is the time to take care of yourself. Rest, eat a well-balanced diet rich in protein, walk every day if possible, take a more positive attitude, and feel good about yourself. It takes a great deal of courage and determination to undergo what you have been through. 5. Post-Operative Activities. Once you are home, the aerobic exercise permitted is walking. We strongly encourage this, and it should be done in a progressive manner as tolerated, in a safe environment, and on flat surfaces. Avoid any lifting greater than 5 pounds. (Continued) Spine & Scoliosis Specialists \u2013 Discharge Instructions \u2013 Lumbar Spinal Fusion \u2013 Page 2 6. First Post-Operative Examination. Upon your discharge from the hospital, please contact our office at (336) 333-6306 to schedule an appointment 4 weeks from the date of your surgery. At this appointment, sutures will be clipped if necessary, your wound will be checked and x-rays will be taken. Sutures for lumbar fusions are usually absorbable and do not need to be removed. You will be seen by a physician assistant. If you have any specific questions regarding your progress, it is a good idea to make a list and address these questions when you come in for this visit. 7. Lumbar Brace. If deemed necessary by your physician, you may be required to wear a lumbar brace. It will be necessary for you to adhere to wearing your lumbar brace on a daily basis. You should wear your brace when you are on your feet and especially when you go out for a walk or ride in a car. Don\u2019t be alarmed if you cannot tolerate wearing your brace during the initial post-op period. You may have residual inflammation and swelling around the surgical area which may make wearing the brace somewhat difficult. Give it time. 9. Things to Avoid. \u2022 Prolonged standing in one place and prolonged sitting are not recommended as this may cause increased soreness and/or stiffness. If you need to sit for a prolonged period of time, it would be wise for you to get up intermittently, walk around and stretch your legs. \u2022 Avoid bending until otherwise instructed by your doctor. \u2022 Do not lift objects over 5 pounds. \u2022 Avoid movements that were not recommended. You will be given instructions by a physical therapist while in the hospital on proper body mechanics. \u2022 Minimize the amount of time spent in an automobile. \u2022 If an activity provokes any discomfort, don\u2019t do it!!! 10. Vitamin Supplements. It is important that you take vitamin supplements post-operatively while your fusion is healing. We recommend that you take the following, with plenty of water: at least one Multi-Vitamin daily; 400 units twice daily of Vitamin D; and 500 mg twice daily of Calcium Citrate. You can obtain all of these at your local pharmacy, over-the-counter. A successful post-operative recuperation is, in part, dependent on yo",

      "text_content": "Patient Discharge Instructions: Spinal Fusion Diet You may resume the type of diet you had before surgery. Eating a well-balanced diet is important for proper wound healing. The doctor or nurse will let you know if you need a specific diet or food consistency. Medications Your doctor will provide you with prescriptions for the medication you are to take at home. You may fill your prescriptions at the UCLA Outpatient Pharmacy, or you can have them filled at a pharmacy closer to your home. Before your discharge, your nurse will review with you and write down your medication dosage, schedule, and side effects. It is important to take your medications as ordered and try to stay on schedule. Do not take aspirin or blood thinners unless ordered or cleared by your surgeon. Comfort and Pain Management It is common to have a headache/pain after surgery, which may last a few days or a few weeks. You will have pain medications prescribed by your doctor for your pain management. The medication may be irritating to the stomach lining, it is advisable to take it with a teaspoon of applesauce or non-fat yogurt. Pain medication (narcotics) may cause constipation. Use a stool softener or gentle laxative if this occurs. If the medications are ineffective, call your doctor\u2019s office to discuss on-going pain management. Expectations for Home You should clarify who will be picking you up on the day of your surgery (if outpatient), or on the day of your discharge (before 11:00 am, if inpatient). Overview of Daily Activities You may feel more tired for 1-3 weeks after surgery. Make sure to get plenty of rest. You should walk 2-4 times a day, with a short gradual increase in your daily activities. When you see your surgeon in the follow-up appointment, he or she will discuss decreasing the limits on activity at that time. You must have clearance from your doctor before participating in any strenuous exercises/activity. Activity Restrictions Do not lift anything over 5 pounds (including pets or children). Do not bend or twist your back. You may sit in a straight back chair (90 degrees) for about 10 minutes to eat. Otherwise, the preferred positions are standing, walking, lying down or sitting in a recliner (approximately 45 degrees). 1 Resume to Work/Driving/Air Travel You must have clearance from your doctor before returning to work or flying. This will be discussed at your post-operative visit. Do not drive until you are cleared by your surgeon. Do not drive while you are on prescription pain medications. Wound/Suture Care Keep your incision clean and dry at all times. Your surgeon may ask you to cover the incision site with Tegaderm film or you can also use Press\u2019n Seal plastic wrap that can be found at a drug or grocery store. Each time you shower, your incision/dressing must be keep dry. Staples/sutures will be removed approximately two weeks after your surgery by a physician, physician assistant, or nurse practitioner. When showering, please be gentle on the skin around the incision and allow the scabs to fall off themselves. No soaking in hot tubs, baths, swimming pools, or Jacuzzi until your incision is completely healed. If staples or superficial sutures were used, you may shower 72 hours after your surgery. If no staples were used (if steri-strips or dermabond/skin glue was applied for your incision) you may shower 48 hours after the day of your surgery. Do not use any ointments (including antibacterial ointments) over the incision site. Follow-up Appointment You should be seen in our clinic approximately 2 weeks after your surgery. The physician who discharges you from the hospital will make sure you have a follow up appointment scheduled with your surgeon. You may receive surveys from your surgeon and/or hospital. Please take the time to complete these surveys. We appreciate your honest feedback. Rehabilitation Needs Our rehabilitation professionals will assess you prior to your discharge. Any rehabilitation needs and equipment will be arranged prior to your discharge.

Surgery for this compression is to release the ligament that causes the compression. Symptoms often times resolve quite quickly after surgery, but it may take time for the numbness to resolve. As your body heals from surgery, there is a risk that scar tissue can build up around the tendons and nerve, making it hard to bend your fingers. For this reason, it is very important that you do the following exercises to prevent this from happening. Tendon Gliding Exercises Perform this sequence of fists 10 repetitions, 5 times per day Post operative instructions: Wound Care \uf0b7 Keep your sutures covered at all times. A gauze roll works well for this. \uf0b7 If you notice drainage that is not clear, or have symptoms of heat and redness at the incision site that is getting worse \u2013 you should contact your therapist or physician\u2019s office as soon as possible. Precautions \uf0b7 Avoid bending your wrist forward until you are 2 weeks post operatively, your splint will help with this. Splint \uf0b7 Wear your splint at all times until you see your therapist for the 2nd visit, this will rest your wrist and allow the wound to heal. Returning to Activities \uf0b7 Most patients can resume light use of their hand after surgery right away, but don\u2019t perform heavy lifting, gripping or grasping at this time. 415 Ray C Hunt Drive, Suite 3200 Charlottesville, VA 22903 434-982-HAND (4263) UVA HAND CENTER \u2013 THERAPY Carpal Tunnel Release Home Exercise Program Visit 2 (3 weeks post operatively) Now that you are 3 weeks post operatively, you should have most if not all of your range of motion back, but you will need to continue doing your tendon gliding exercises for at least the next 3 weeks, as your body continues to form scar. Tendon Gliding Exercises Perform this sequence of fists 10 repetitions, 5 times per day Now that your incision is healed and we can be more vigorous with your wrist motion, it is important to glide the median nerve along it\u2019s path to avoid it also being surrounded by scar tissue. That is done by performing this series of motions: Repeat this sequence 5 repetitions, 5 times per day \u2013 Hold each position 10 seconds Post operative instructions: Scar Care \uf0b7 Massage your scar with lotion for 5 minutes 5 times per day. Use a moderately deep pressure to help flatten the scar and decrease its sensitivity to pressure. \uf0b7 Wear the silicone scar pad to sleep to help soften the scar while you sleep. Make sure your skin is clean and dry before applying the scar pad each night. You can wash it each morning with soap and water, and dry it with a CLOTH towel. Splint \uf0b7 Wear your splint at night until 6 weeks post operatively as needed for support. Returning to Activities \uf0b7 Most patients can resume full use of their hand after surgery by about 6 weeks post operatively, but please let your comfort be your guide. Do not repetitively perform activities that cause you pain. A gradual return to activities without pain is our goal. \uf0b7 If you do not feel that your strength is returning by the 6th week, please contact your therapist as you might need one more session to add hand strengthening to your home exercises. 415 Ray C Hunt Drive, Suite 3200 Charlottesville, VA 22903 434-982-HAND (4263)",

      "text_content": "Post-Operative Instructions for Carpal Tunnel Release Dr. Nicholas Meyer Orthopedics & Hand Sports Medicine Surgeon What To Expect After Surgery \u2022 After surgery, it is normal for your hand and fingers to continue to be numb for a period of time due to the local medication used at the time of surgery. \u2022 You will have a well-padded dressing over your wrist and hand. The 2nd day from surgery you can remove the dressing. There may be visible stitches OR small white strips of tape called steri- strips. Leave these in place until your first post-operative appointment. A band-aid may be placed over them to keep them protected and padded. You can then begin to wear your removable wrist brace. This should be worn at night and removed during the day until you are at least 6 weeks from surgery. Please keep incisions clean and dry. You may shower and wash your hands, but avoid soaking in dishwater, bathtub or pool until you are re-evaluated. \u2022 You will be given pain medication to use after surgery. They should be taken with food and as needed. Please do not operative heavy machinery or drive while using narcotic pain medication. \u2022 Your first appointment for evaluation after surgery should be about 2 weeks from surgery. If you do not already have an appointment in place, please call Dr. Meyer\u2019s care team at 651-351- 2639. What Can I Do Safely With My Hand? We advise that you avoid any heavy grasping or gripping activities for at least 6-8 weeks from surgery. If you work a heavy labor job, you may need restrictions for a period of time. We can address this at your regular appointment. Continue to wear your removable wrist brace at night until you are 6 weeks from surgery. You may lift light objects. As a general rule, nothing heavier than a coffee cup until your first post-op appointment. Specific activity questions should be directed back to your provider. When Should I Call My Surgeon? \u2022 Pain is not controlled by pain medication or pain and numbness getting progressively more severe, including minimal use of fingers. \u2022 Increased redness or drainage noted about the incision \u2022 Fever over 101 degrees. \u2022 Prolonged nausea or vomiting, difficulty voiding, or side effects from pain medications. If any of these items occur or you have any questions about your symptoms, please call Dr. Meyer\u2019s care team at 651-351-2639. Exercises Working on very gentle finger range of motion after surgery will help improve your range of motion and decrease swelling and edema. We recommend that you do these exercises 4-5 times a day, 5-10 repetitions each. We can discuss the need for possible outpatient hand therapy at the first appointment after surgery based on your activity level and progress. \u2022 Picture A: Hold fingers straight \u2022 Picture B: Bend fingers into a claw, keep big knuckles straight \u2022 Picture C: Bend all knuckles in to make a full fist \u2022 Picture D: Extend fingers into a 90 degree angle \u2022 Picture E: Bend large and middle knuckles so the pads of the fingertips touch the base of the palm. Tips of fingers should be straight.",

      "text_content": "Post-Operative Instructions for Carpal Tunnel Release Purpose of surgery The goal of the operation is to decompress the Median nerve at the level of your wrist to help relieve the pressure upon it. The consequence is the gradual decrease or elimination of symptoms like numbness/tingling, weakness, clumsiness, and pain. What to expect after surgery? You will have a soft dressing that covers the wound on your palm and part of your forearm. You may have some numbness or tingling of fingers due to the local anesthetic injections used to help control post-operative pain (this should wear off within about 24 hours). What should you do to help recover? While we do not anticipate significant swelling following this procedure, it would be helpful to keep your hand/wrist elevated as best you can for the first 24 hours after surgery. You can also apply an icepack or frozen vegetables to the palm side of the dressing at the level of your wrist to help keep swelling to a minimum. To help your recovery, keep your fingers moving. Make sure you can make a fist with your fingers and completely straighten them. Make sure you can move your thumb across your hand towards your pinky finger and fully straighten it. Repeat these motions and efforts throughout the day, especially in the first few days following surgery to keep internal scarring from becoming an issue. Keep your pain under control. While I do not anticipate significant pain, I want to make sure you are comfortable. Take the prescription pain medicine as prescribed for the first day and then decide the next day to what extent you need it. Keeping yourself comfortable will allow you to keep your fingers moving and minimize internal scarring from the surgery. How should you take care of your dressing/wound? Keep the dressing and all the skin covered, clean and dry for about five days. Afterwards, you may remove the dressing yourself prior to coming in for your first post-operative visit. The wound is covered by a non-adherent patch, followed by gauze, a wrap, a stocking, cotton wrap, and finally, the ACE wrap. Once the surgical dressing is removed, keep the wound and your skin clean. Soap and water are an excellent skin cleanser, and it is OK to get everything wet in a shower with running water. Avoid immersing your wound under water until the sutures are removed. Please do not use salves like Neosporin or Bacitracin for the wound. I would prefer soap and water or peroxide; and, I want you to keep it covered with a non-adherent bandage \u2013 your wound does not need air to heal, just cleanliness. How should my hand respond to the surgery? As I probably explained to you in the office, the speed and extent of your recovery is somewhat variable, but very dependent upon the severity of your nerve test. Studies have demonstrated conclusively that the length of time for improvement is directly related to the severity of the nerve compression. The more severe your carpal tunnel syndrome, the longer it will take to reap the benefit of surgery. For those with severe carpal tunnel syndrome, and for those with any evidence of nerve damage, the recovery can occur over the course of one to two years. For those with minor or moderate carpal tunnel syndrome, the recovery usually occurs over the course of 6 months to a year; but most experience noticeable improvements within days to weeks. For many, the earliest noticeable difference is the resolution of nighttime numbness and discomfort. This is usually recognized within one to two weeks. Daytime symptoms, clumsiness, and weakness will take longer. I expect that you will be resuming your regular activity as soon as you feel comfortable \u2013 and this definitely helps the overall recovery! What should concern you? Please refer to our website (www.HandCenterGA.com) for helping you to understand our general concerns following any operation. As for your carpal tunnel release, there are only a few things I would ask you to pay attention to should they occur: new numbness/tingling, worsening numbness/tingling, increasing pain, stiffness of fingers, progressive redness around the wound. I want you to call us should any of these occur at 404-255-0226. When should you come in for your first Post-operative visit? Your first visit will be within 7-10 days of the operation. That visit should be arranged during your pre-operative appointment. If not, call 404-255-0226 to make that appointment. Do you need therapy? Most people do not require therapy to recover from carpal tunnel release. On the other hand, I will offer it to you if you are having prolonged discomfort, persistent swelling, or trouble getting your fingers to move fully. What activities can you do? You can do anything that does not hurt with some exception. Avoid or limit repetitive activities like typing for about a week to keep from creating swelling that will prolong discomfort. Limit yourself to lifting with the operative hand for a few days or so until it becomes more comfortable. Ever",

Haque, MD Hand and Upper Extremity Surgery CAO - Summit Orthopedics Division (301) 657-9876 The Surgery Your endoscopic carpal tunnel release surgery is an outpatient procedure that will be done in a formal operating room. After checking into our registration desk, you will be taken to a preoperative holding area where you will change into a gown, meet with your surgeon, your anesthesia staff, nurses, and other members of our team to evaluate you and prepare you for the procedure. You will then be taken to the operating room. The surgery is typically performed under a type of local anesthesia with sedation through an IV to make you more relaxed. Because of the sedation, it is very important that you have nothing to eat or drink after midnight the evening prior to surgery. You will also need to have someone else drive you home. If you are unable to meet these two needs, your surgery may have to be cancelled and rescheduled for another date. In the operating room, the OR staff will require about fifteen minutes to anesthetize, prep, and drape your arm. After this, the surgery itself will take less than half an hour. During the operation, a two-inch transverse incision will be made in your wrist crease to release the carpal tunnel and some fibrous tissue in the forearm just above the wrist. Your nerve will be fully freed from compression, then the incision will be closed with nylon stitches. I usually inject the wound with a long-acting local anesthetic to give you an additional few hours of pain relief. A bulky dressing is placed on the hand and wrist, and you will be taken back to the preoperative holding area for recovery. Once you are comfortable and can drink clear fluids, you may go home. Post-operative Protocol and Instructions The first week For the first few days, you should elevate and rest your hand as much as possible. Feel free to move your fingers, but it may cause some wrist and hand pain. Light typing or writing for no more than ten minutes at a time is allowed, but if it causes pain you should discontinue. You may not lift anything heavier than a cup of coffee with your surgical hand. You can get some swelling in your fingers, but as long as you can move them without severe pain, this is normal. You may have extensive bruising in the forearm and fingers, but this is also normal. You may be given a prescription for pain medication to take as needed, but most patients only need Tylenol or Advil. Please keep the dressing clean and dry. When you shower, place a plastic bag over the hand and forearm and seal it well above the dressing to keep it dry. A newspaper bag or umbrella bag works well. The 8th day after surgery until your 1st follow-up visit On the 8th day after surgery, you may do a little more with the hand. You may remove the dressing yourself. You should clean the wound with alcohol and cover the wound with a waterproof bandaid. Please repeat this daily until you see me. You should continue to move your fingers and gently try to open and close your hand more frequently during this time. You may type and write for up to 15 minutes at a time with low speed, but you should discontinue if your pain increases. You should still avoid any lifting anything heavier than a cup of coffee or grasp tightly during this time. You should call my office if you have progressively worsening pain that is not relieved by icing, rest, elevation, and your prescription pain medication. You should also call if you have a persistent fever of greater than 101\u02daF or notice progressive drainage on the dressing before your 1st post-operative visit. The 1st follow-up visit \u2013 approximately 2 weeks after surgery At this visit, I will check your wound. The sutures are usually removed and steristrips will be placed on the wound. Most patients who have had numbness for less than a year experience markedly improved sensation at this time. If you have significant stiffness, I may send you to occupational therapy for a few weeks. Otherwise, I will just progress your activity. You should still only lift up to a 2 pounds with the operative hand for the next 2 weeks, then slowly increase to full lifting. You may now get the wound wet, but you should not scrub it for two more weeks. Simply pat it dry with a towel when you are done washing. The steristrips will start to detach in the next few days. When they peel off more than half-way, remove them completely. You can leave the wound uncovered as long as it is in a clean, safe environment. The 2nd follow-up visit I typically see you again in the office at about six weeks after surgery. If you have regained full sensation and range of motion, I will just have you follow up with me as needed. You may progress your activity and return to normal use of the hand over the next month. If you are still having stiffness, numbness or pain, I will start other treatments such as medications, therapy, or splinting as indic",

Dr. Colten Luedke, Orthopaedic Surgery - 979-776-0169 www.BCSortho.com www.DRCLuedke.com BCSortho.com DRCL It is common to have post-operative pain. You may wrap a bag of frozen peas or crushed ice in a thin towel and place on your incision sites for 15 minutes of every hour while you are awake. Elevating your hand above heart level on several pillows will also help with post-operative pain. You should take the prescribed medication only as needed and as prescribed. If you are having increased pain, you may take an anti-inflammatory medication such as Advil, Motrin or Aleve with your pain medication but DO NOT take Tylenol with the pain medication prescribed After Your Surgery \u2014 Weeks 2\u20134 \uf0b7 Follow-up appointment o Incision will be inspected. o Sutures will be removed. \uf0b7 Exercises \u2013 5 to 10 repetitions, 3 times a day o Range of motion exercises \uf0a7 Rotate your wrist up and down, side to side \uf0a7 Stretch your fingers apart, relax them, stretch again \uf0a7 Stretch your thumb by pulling it back, hold it, then release and repeat o Strengthening exercises \uf0a7 Squeeze a rubber ball \uf0a7 Wrist curls with a 3-pound weight \uf0b7 Scar tissue management and desensitization o Scar massage \u2013 Apply thick lotion or cream to your scar in a circular motion (firmly) for 5 minutes at least 4 times per day. o Desensitization \u2013 Rub the scar site for one minute every day. o Continue with scar massage for 6 months after surgery. Scar Management and Desensitization Dr. Colten Luedke, Orthopaedic Surgery - 979-776-0169 www.BCSortho.com www.DRCLuedke.com BCSortho.com DRCL During your surgical procedure for carpal tunnel syndrome, your surgeon will release the transverse carpal ligament in your hand, leaving a gap where the ligament was cut. The gap eventually will fill with scar tissue. Two days after your sutures are removed, if the skin is completely closed, you will need to start massaging the scar. You will place your finger on the scar, and maintaining pressure move your finger in circles, diagonals, up and down, and side to side. Do this all along the length of the scar. Do not rub the skin, move the skin. Over time, the scar tissue matures and becomes less pliable. As it tightens, scar tissue can: \uf0b7 Interfere with achieving full range of motion \uf0b7 Cause pain \uf0b7 Cause hypersensitivity on or around the scar surface Often, the surgical site/scar and surrounding tissue are left feeling hypersensitive because the scar tissue and swelling have interrupted your skin\u2019s sensory nerve fibers. Performing scar massage and desensitization techniques can help your sensory nerves to normalize and function properly again. Frequently Asked Questions Can I use my hand after surgery for carpal tunnel syndrome? Starting immediately, you can move your hand for gentle range of motion. No lifting heavier than a telephone or coffee mug for 2 weeks. Can I drive after surgery? Dr. Colten Luedke, Orthopaedic Surgery - 979-776-0169 www.BCSortho.com www.DRCLuedke.com BCSortho.com DRCL You may not drive yourself home from surgery. You must have a driver. You may not drive when you are taking narcotic pain medication. Your surgeon will tell you how long after your surgery until you can drive again. The legal position is that it\u2019s the patient who makes the decision as to whether you are safe to drive. How long will I be off work after surgery? When you can return to work depends on your progress, as assessed by your surgeon. Generally, you can return to work in 1 to 2 weeks. Call Immediately If You Experience Severe pain or swelling o Nail discoloration from pink to white or blue o Excessive bleeding or drainage o Increased redness o Fever of 101\u00b0F or greater o If any of these signs appear, consult your physician immediately Dr. Colten Luedke, Orthopaedic Surgery - 979-776-0169 www.BCSortho.com www.DRCLuedke.com BCSortho.com DRCL Dr. Colten Luedke, Orthopaedi",

If you are participating in this program, a dressing supply kit will be mailed directly to your home after surgery and will include further instructions. d. The initial postoperative dressing and the collagen surgical dressings are water- resistant. You may shower with either type of dressing in place, when desired, but you must sit down and keep your knee straight when showering. Do not submerge in a bath tub. e. Remember not to bend your knee when doing any dressing changes and re-apply the knee immobilizer afterwards. 3. Prevention of deep venous thrombosis (blood clot): a. The best way to avoid a blood clot is to ambulate regularly. b. If you do not usually take any other blood thinning medications, then you will start taking aspirin 81 mg by mouth once per day on the morning of postoperative day #1 and continue this for 4 weeks. c. If you already take a blood thinning medication at baseline, then your instructions are as follows: ____________________________________________ __________________________________________________________________ 4. Pain control: a. The best way to control pain is to control swelling. The best way to control swelling is to elevate your surgical lower extremity above the level of your heart as much as possible and apply ice often. b. Start taking acetaminophen on the day after surgery, or the day that you get home from the hospital. Take 1000 mg by mouth three times per day and continue this for 2 weeks. c. An electronic prescription has been sent to your pharmacy for a 2 week supply of meloxicam, which is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID). This medication helps to decrease postoperative inflammation, swelling, and pain. Start taking this on the day after surgery, or the day after you get home from the hospital. Some patients have been advised by their family physician to avoid NSAIDs. If you are unsure, call your family physician to ask. d. An electronic prescription has been sent to your pharmacy for a 1 week supply of narcotic pain medication. Narcotic pain medication is sedating and constipating. Increase your fluid intake and use over-the-counter stool softeners as needed to help with constipation. Use the narcotic pain medication when your pain is most severe. Wean yourself off of the narcotic pain medication as soon as possible. e. The acetaminophen and meloxicam are intended to be taken every day as instructed above for 2 weeks postoperatively. The narcotic pain medication may be utilized on an as needed basis. Some patients find it necessary to utilize more of the narcotic pain medication and some patients find it necessary to utilize less. It is safe to combine narcotic pain medication, acetaminophen, and meloxicam. 5. Reasons to call the office: a. Foul odor or excessive drainage from your surgical dressing. b. Increasing pain not relieved by pain medication. c. New numbness or tingling. d. Signs or symptoms of systemic illness (fever, chills, nausea, generalized weakness or body aches, etc.). 6.

      "text_content": "Rehabilitation Protocol for Arthroscopic Meniscal Repair This protocol is intended to guide clinicians through the post-operative course for meniscal repair. This protocol is time based (dependent on tissue healing) as well as criterion based. Specific intervention should be based on the needs of the individual and should consider exam findings and clinical decision making. The timeframes for expected outcomes contained within this guideline may vary based on surgeon\u2019s preference, additional procedures performed, and/or complications. If a clinician requires assistance in the progression of a post-operative patient, they should consult with the referring surgeon. The interventions included within this protocol are not intended to be an inclusive list of exercises. Therapeutic interventions should be included and modified based on the progress of the patient and under the discretion of the clinician. Considerations for the Post-operative Meniscal Repair Many different factors influence the post-operative meniscal repair rehabilitation outcomes, including type and location of the meniscal tear and repair. Consider taking a more conservative approach to range of motion, weight bearing, and rehab progression with more complex tears or all-inside meniscal repairs. Additionally, this protocol does not apply to meniscus root repairs or meniscus transplants. It is recommended that clinicians collaborate closely with the referring physician regarding intra-operative findings and satisfaction with the strength of the repair. Post-operative considerations If you develop a fever, intense calf pain, excessive drainage from the incision, uncontrolled pain or any other symptoms you have concerns about you should call your doctor.

      "text_content": "Post-Operative Instructions Meniscus Repair DIET \u2022 Begin with clear liquids and light foods (jello, soups, etc). \u2022 Advance to normal diet as tolerated. WOUND CARE \u2022 Maintain your operative dressing, loosen bandage if swelling of the foot and ankle occurs. \u2022 It is normal for the knee to bleed and swell following surgery \u2013 if blood soaks onto the ACE bandage, you may reinforce with additional dressing. \u2022 To avoid infection, keep surgical incisions clean and dry \u2013 you may shower by placing a large garbage bag over your brace starting the day after surgery \u2013 No immersion of operative leg (i.e. bath). MEDICATION \u2022 Most patients will require narcotic pain medication for a short period of time \u2013 this can be taken as per directions by pharmacy. \u2022 Common side effects of the pain medication are nausea, drowsiness, and constipation \u2013 to decrease the side effects, take medication with food \u2013 if constipation occurs, consider taking an over-the-counter laxative. \u2022 If you are having problems with nausea and vomiting, contact the office to possibly have your medication changed. \u2022 Do not drive a car or operate machinery while taking the narcotic medication. \u2022 Ibuprophen 200-400mg (i.e. Advil) may be taken in between the narcotic pain medication to supplement pain control, reduce amount of pain medication required, and increase the time intervals between narcotic pain medication usage. \u2022 Take one adult aspirin (325 mg) a day x 10 days to help prevent blood clots. Do not take if allergic or medically unable. ACTIVITY \u2022 Elevate the operative leg to chest level whenever possible to decrease swelling. \u2022 Use crutches to assist with walking initially. You must be partial weight bearing only (30- 50%). No squatting. \u2022 Do not engage in activities which increase knee pain/swelling (prolonged periods of standing or walking) over the first 7-10 days following surgery. \u2022 Avoid long periods of sitting (without leg elevated) or long distance traveling for 2 weeks. \u2022 No driving until instructed otherwise by physician. \u2022 May return to sedentary work only or school 2-3 days after surgery, as tolerated. \u2022 If you plan on flying within the first month of surgery, let Dr. Levin know so he can prescribe Lovenox (blood thinner). Dr. Levin recommends avoiding flying in first post-op month. BRACE \u2022 Your brace should be 0-45\u00b0 for partial weight bearing, 50% ambulation with crutches. \u2022 Remove brace for sleep. ICE THERAPY \u2022 Begin immediately after surgery. \u2022 Use ice machine continuously or ice packs (if machine is not prescribed depending upon insurance coverage) every 2 hours for 20 minute intervals daily until your first post-operative visit \u2013 remember to keep leg elevated to level of chest while icing. \u2022 Never apply ice directly to skin. Always have a towel or layer of clothing between ice and skin. EXERCISE \u2022 Begin exercises 24 hours after surgery (straight leg raises, quad sets, heel slides, and ankle pumps) unless otherwise instructed. \u2022 Discomfort and knee stiffness is normal for a few days following surgery - it is safe and preferable to bend your knee to 90\u00b0 (unless otherwise instructed by physician). \u2022 Complete exercises 3-4 times daily until your first post-operative visit \u2013 your motion goals are to have complete extension (straightening) and 90\u00b0of flexion (bending) at your first post-operative visit unless otherwise instructed. \u2022 Do ankle pumps continuously throughout the day to reduce the possibility of a blood clot in your calf. \u2022 Formal physical therapy (PT) will begin after your first post-operative visit. EMERGENCIES** \u2022 Contact Dr. Levin if any of the following are present: o Painful swelling or numbness o Unrelenting pain o Fever (over 101\u00b0 \u2013 it is normal to have a low grade fever for the first day or two following surgery) or chills. o Redness around incisions o Continuous drainage or bleeding from incision (a small amount of drainage is expected) o Difficulty breathing o Excessive nausea or vomiting ** If you have an emergency after office hours or on the weekend, call 847-570-2825 and you will be connected to our page service. **If you have an emergency that requires immediate attention, proceed to the nearest emergency room. FOLLOW-UP \u2022 If you do not already have a post-operative appointment scheduled, please contact the scheduling office during normal office hours at 847-570-2825 and schedule an appointment for 2-5 days post-op.

      "text_content": "Initial Postoperative Instructions ACL Reconstruction + Meniscus Repair Dr. Mia S.

Do not take with alcohol or additional Tylenol as it can put you at risk of liver damage. You can take 1-\u00ad\u20102 pills every 4 hours as needed for pain. \u2022 Naproxen \u2013 this is an anti-\u00ad\u2010inflammatory. You will take a prescription-\u00ad\u2010strength dose of this for 10 days and then you can taper. Take with food and do not continue taking if it causes pain in your stomach. You will take this twice a day. \u2022 Colace \u2013 this prevents constipation caused by Percocet. You can take this twice a day. \u2022 Zofran \u2013 this is to prevent nausea/vomiting caused by Percocet. Also taking the Percocet with food can help.

Dressing: \u2022 You may remove your dressing after 48 hours. It is normal to see bloody bandages when you take off the dressing. \u2022 Leave the tape strips (\u201cSteri-\u00ad\u2010Strips\u201d) over your incisions. Do not remove. They will stay on for 1-\u00ad\u20102 weeks and slowly peel off. You can apply gauze or Band-\u00ad\u2010aids over the wounds, make sure you change them daily. \u2022 You may shower and let the water run over your incisions (and the white tape strips) 48 hours after your surgery. Do not scrub the incisions. Pat dry. Do not soak the incisions in a bath, hot tub, or pool until at least 3 weeks after surgery. \u2022 Your stitches will be removed/trimmed around 1-\u00ad\u20102 weeks. \u2022 DO NOT APPLY LOTION/OINTMENT TO YOUR INCISION. \u2022 You will be given thigh-\u00ad\u2010high compression stockings after surgery. These are to reduce the risk of blood clots. They also decrease swelling in your feet after surgery.

You may take them off to sleep, shower or to clean them (hand wash then air dry). Alternatively you can use an ace wrap. Weight bearing & activities: \u2022 You must be non-\u00ad\u2010weight bearing with brace and crutches until cleared by your surgeon. When you are using crutches your brace must be locked in extension. You must wear the hinged-\u00ad\u2010knee brace for the first 6 weeks. This brace protects the meniscus repair because it prevents you from bending the knee past 90 degrees. It is OK to remove the brace for showering but be careful. \u2022 Rest and elevate your leg (above the level of your heart if possible) for the first 24 hours by placing a pillow under your calf and/or ankle. \u2022 Do NOT place a pillow under your knee as it will keep you from straightening your knee. \u2022 IT IS VERY IMPORTANT TO GET YOUR LEG AS STRAIGHT AS POSSIBLE AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. \u2022 Start physical therapy (PT) within the first week after surgery. Please give the \u201cPost-\u00ad\u2010 Operative ACL Rehabilitation\u201d guidelines (pages 5-\u00ad\u20108 of this packet) to your PT. Ice/Ice Cooling Unit: \u2022 Icing will help a lot with pain. \u2022 Ice up to 20 minutes every hour. Use routinely for the first 2 days. Then you can taper to at least 3 times per day for 2 weeks, and then as needed after that. \u2022 Do not put ice in direct contact with skin. If you have an ice cooling unit, do not place the pad in direct contact with skin. \u2022 Do not wear ice or cooling unit when you are sleeping \u2013 it can burn your skin and lead to serious injury. If you received a Nerve Block: \u2022 You were given an injection before/after surgery to block the conduction of your femoral nerve which controls pain, sensation, and your quadriceps muscle contraction. \u2022 You should be relatively pain free for the first night but have little control of your leg. You should wear the knee immobilizer until the feeling returns in your leg (this will keep you from falling if you put weight on your leg). University of Washington Department of Orthopaedics & Sports Medicine \u2022 Make sure to start the Percocet on the first night before you go to sleep, even if you don\u2019t feel any pain because the block may wear off during the night and it can be difficult to catch up with the pain. Follow-\u00ad\u2010up: You will be seen by Travis, our physician assistant, at 1-\u00ad\u20102 weeks after surgery for a wound check and removal or trimming of stitches. You will be seen by Dr. Hagen at 6 weeks after surgery. Timing and length of additional follow-\u00ad\u2010ups will be determined by your progress.

This surgical procedure uses small incisions to locate, identify and treat problems inside the knee. A suture device is used to repair the tear in the meniscus back together. During surgery, sterile fluid, such as normal saline (a fluid containing sodium and chloride), is flushed through the knee joint. This causes the joint space to expand, allowing the doctor to see and freely work in the joint space. During surgery, some of the fluid is absorbed into surrounding tissue and may seep back out onto your dressing the first day after surgery. Due to the fluid used during surgery, your knee may be stiff and swollen after surgery.

      "text_content": "MENISCUS REPAIR SURGERY - POSTOPERATIVE INSTRUCTIONS Arthroscopy is a minimally invasive procedure that allows the surgeon to investigate the joint with a small camera and work with thin instruments through small incisions. Knee arthroscopy is recommended to treat various conditions of the knee. We can include: damaged cartilage, torn meniscus, torn ligaments, infection, and others. A meniscus is a crescent-shaped fibrocartilaginous structure located between your thighbone( femur ) and shinbone( tibia ). Each knee has two menisci( plural of meniscus ). They act as shock absorbers and help stabilize the joint. Meniscus tears are common knee injuries, especially among people who play sports. If surgery was indicated, the surgeon may remove a piece of the torn meniscus( partial meniscectomy ), and the whole meniscus( total meniscectomy - rarely performed ) or repair it if possible. The surgeon's efforts are all to preserve the meniscus. MENISCUS REPAIR SURGERY The surgery usually takes between 1-2 hours, unless unexpected injuries are found. Both general and regional anesthesia can be used. Additionally, you may receive a nerve block. This will be decided between you and the anesthesiologist before surgery. The surgeon inserts an instrument called an arthroscope and other pencil-sized instruments into the joint through small incisions. The arthroscope is equipped with a video camera that transmits the image of the inside of your knee to an external monitor. The surgeon will look inside the knee and after having made an inventory of it, will remove the damaged tissue, and will perform the meniscus repair. Several suturing techniques can be performed and your surgeon will decide which one is most suitable for your injury. RECOVERY It depends on the type of surgery you had, your injury, activity level, age, smoking status, adherence to rehabilitation, etc. However, if you have had a meniscus repair your recovery time will be longer compared to a meniscectomy. POSTOPERATIVE CARE: MENISCUS REPAIR SURGERY \u2022 Swelling is one of the most important factors involved in knee arthroscopy causing postoperative pain. \u2022 Keeping the leg elevated and the frequent application of ice (cold therapy) are important ways to reduce swelling around the knee. \u2022 Elevation is achieved by placing pillows under the entire leg so that the heel is elevated higher than the knee. And you need to elevate your leg above the level of your heart. \u2022 The knee must be fully extended at the end of the second week. \u2022 Your foot and ankle may be swollen after surgery. You are encouraged to elevate and move your foot and ankle several times a day to reduce swelling. \u2022 NO heavy squatting for 4 months. \u2022 Do not apply ice (cold therapy) if your nerve block is still in effect (IF HAVING A NERVE BLOCK). \u2022 You will be restricted from flexing (bending) the knee past 90 degrees for 6 weeks. Footbridge Centre for Integrated Orthopaedic Care Inc. Unit 221, 181 Keefer Place t: 778-945-6756 Vancouver, BC V6B 6Cl f: 778-945-677 5 www.Jootbridgec/inic.com MENISCUS REPAIR SURGERY - POSTOPERATIVE INSTRUCTIONS BRACE \u2022 Meniscus repair - you may wear a brace for your comfort for a few days. PAIN MANAGEMENT \u2022 Medication, limb elevation, ice therapy and mobilization are essential in pain management. \u2022 The usual regimen we use is a combination of acetaminophen, anti-inflammatory drugs, and narcotics. \u2022 Taking your pain medicine as prescribed by your surgeon regularly will help you manage your pain more effectively, even if you are in mild pain. \u2022 If strong painkiller (hydromorphone, morphine, oxycodone, etc) has been prescribed, don't wait until the pain is severe. Use strictly as prescribed by your doctor. Do not take an extra dose. \u2022 IF HAVING A NERVE BLOCK: it is important to start taking regular pain medication before the nerve block wears off (see the Nerve Block HANDOUT for more information). WEIGHT BEARING \u2022 You will be non-weight bearing for 6 weeks, and you must use a walking aid (crutches, walker, wheelchair) for your comfort. \u2022 No rotation for 3 months. \u2022 Footbridge Clinic has a Physiotherapy team that is used to our protocols. They will help you with gait training right after surgery and regain your normal gait pattern during the rehabilitation process. COLD THERAPY (ICE THERAPY) \u2022 DO NOT use cold therapy if your nerve block is still in effect. You should wait until your function and normal sensation have returned.(IF HAVING A NERVE BLOCK) \u2022 The knee is the largest joint in the body. The ice pack must be large enough to cover the front area of the knee. \u2022 You could apply ice for up to 20 minutes, remove it for an hour and repeat the application 6 to 8 times a day, always with one-hour intervals. Remember that you must put a thin towel between the ice/ice pack and your skin. \u2022 If you are using a CRYO THERAPY UNIT please follow the manufacturer's directions. \u2022 DO NOT SLEEP WITH ICE.

It is normal for the joint to bleed and swell after surgery. If blood soaks into the ACE bandage, please reinforce with additional gauze dressing. Loosen bandages if swelling or progressive numbness occurs in the extremity (If swelling becomes concerning please reach out to Dr. Frank's office) \u25cb Remove surgical dressings 3 days after surgery. \u25cb Please LEAVE STERI-STRIPS IN PLACE OVER INCISIONS until first appointment. There may be some incisions that do not have steri-strips over them. \u25cb Showering: Once bandages are removed, you may shower with water-proof band-aids over incision and steri-strips. Please take caution as to not pull off steri-strips when removing band- aids. \u25cf Medications: \u25cb Pain Control: Local pain medication is injected into the knee during surgery \u2013 this will wear off within 4-6 hours. Most patients will require some narcotic pain medication (i.e. hydrocodone, or other codeine-derivative) for a few days after surgery \u2013 please take as instructed. It is important not to drink alcohol or drive while taking narcotic medication. If your pain is minimal, you may discontinue the use of narcotics. \u25cb Blood Clot Prevention: Unless otherwise instructed, take one aspirin 81 mg twice daily for 4 weeks following surgery. This may lower the risk of a blood clot developing after surgery. Should severe calf pain occur or significant swelling of calf and ankle, please call the doctor. \u25cb Other Medications: \u25a0 Anti-Inflammatory: Multiple over the counter options \u2192 only use 1 of these options, and stop immediately if experiencing side effects (indigestion, heartburn, bloody stool) \u25cf Ibuprofen 600-800 mg (i.e. Advil, Motrin): Take every 8 hours as needed \u25cf Naproxen 220-440mg (i.e. Aleve): Take every 12 hours as needed with food \u25cf Meloxicam 15mg (i.e. Mobic): Take once daily as needed with food \u25a0 Anti-Nausea: Zofran (Ondansetron): Take every 8 hours as needed for nausea \u25a0 Muscle Relaxant: Flexeril (Cyclobenzaprine): Take every 8 hours as needed for muscle spasms \u25cb Constipation: The use of narcotics can lead to constipation. Adequate hydration, over-the counter stool softeners, and mobility can minimize constipation problems. \u25cb Normal medications: Resume the day after surgery unless otherwise instructed. Meniscus Repair Post Operative Instructions \u25cf Weight-Bearing: Full weight bearing Partial weight bearing Toe touch weight bearing \u25cf Activity: Unless otherwise instructed, you should begin ankle pump exercises as demonstrated on the exercise handout on the first day after surgery. Please limit the range of motion 0-90 degrees. Do not engage in activities which increase knee pain/swelling (prolonged periods of standing or walking) over the first 7-10 days after surgery. While exercise is important, don\u2019t over-do it. \u25cf Brace: Brace is to be worn at all times, day and night, except hygiene and prescribed exercises. Brace is to remain locked in full extension for 2 weeks or until directed to unlock. \u25cf Elevation: Rest and elevate your leg for the first 3-5 days. Do not place a pillow only under your knee. Instead, elevate with a pillow under your calf and ankle, with your knee kept straight. \u25cf Diet: The anesthetic drugs used during your surgery may cause nausea for the first 24 hours. Following surgery, begin with clear liquids and light foods. You can progress to your normal diet if not nauseated. If nausea and vomiting become severe or if you show signs of dehydration (lack of urination), please call the office. \u25cf Driving: No driving until permitted by the surgical team. \u25cf Work/School: May return to sedentary work or school 3-4 days after surgery, if pain is tolerable.

      "text_content": "Meniscus Repair Postoperative Instructions David P. Trofa, M.D. Assistant Professor of Orthopaedic Surgery, Columbia University Medical Center Chief of Sports Medicine, New York-Presbyterian Westchester Director of Clinical Outcomes, Department of Orthopaedic Surgery Head Team Physician, Columbia University www.DavidTrofaMD.com ABOUT YOUR SURGERY \u25cf Thank you for entrusting me with your surgical care. Please feel free to contact my office with any questions or concerns that you may have during your postoperative recovery, and I will make sure that all your concerns are adequately addressed. \u25cf With this surgery, we performed a meniscus repair. With time this should help reduce pain, prevent mechanical symptoms (clicking, catching and popping) in your knee and decrease the risk of future arthritis. POSTOPERATIVE OFFICE VISIT \u25cf You should have an office visit scheduled within 7-10 days after your surgery. MEDICATIONS \u25cf Prescriptions for pain and other applicable medication will be sent to your pharmacy before your procedure. Pain Medication \u25cf The goal of the multimodal pain regimen is to minimize the amount of narcotic (opioid) medications that you require for postoperative pain control. \u25cf You should discuss these medications with your primary care doctor to make sure there are no interactions with any other medications that you are taking, and that your kidneys and/or liver are healthy enough for their use. \u25cf Always eat prior to taking medication. Do not take medication on an empty stomach. \u25cf If you had a regional nerve block, start taking pain medication when you feel pins and needles. Do not wait until you have pain. If the block has not worn off before you go to sleep, take a dose of pain medication anyway. \u25cf If you don\u2019t have a bowel movement by the third day, take Colace (Docusate) and Senna over the counter as per package instructions. Anticoagulation (Blood Thinners) \u25cf You will receive a prescription for Aspirin 325 mg (#21 total) to be taken once daily with food for prophylaxis against blood clots unless you have a contraindication to this medication. \u25cf Ambulation, foot/hand pumps, and movement of the surgical site within the confines of the weightbearing and motion restrictions provided are additional ways to reduce the occurrence of blood clots after surgery. \u25cf Seek emergency attention if you develop increasing leg pain, swelling that does not decrease with elevation of the lower extremity, enlargement of veins near the skin, reddish skin discoloration, or skin that is warm to touch. TRAVELING \u25cf Avoid air travel for a minimum of two weeks after surgery on the lower extremity to decrease your risk of blood clots. \u25cf If air travel is necessary, please inform the office as we will increase your dose of aspirin to 325mg BID for five days. \u25cf Also, if air travel is necessary either walk frequently or do ankle pump exercises (flex your foot up and down repeatedly) in your seat every hour. This squeezes the blood vessels, helping to prevent the formation of blood clots. \u25cf Stay well hydrated as dehydration causes the blood to thicken. \u25cf Avoid alcohol consumption as alcohol can cause dehydration. DRESSING CHANGES, WOUND CARE, AND BATHING \u25cf You will leave the operating room with a soft dressing and ace wrap placed over your surgical incision. This can be removed in 2-3 days. \u25cf You may shower after removing the dressings. Allow water to run over the wound, but you should not bathe, scrub or soak your surgical site. Please do not apply any lotions, creams, or ointments directly to the incisions until 30 days after surgery. \u25cf AVOID STEAM ROOMS, SWIMMING POOLS, AND TUBS FOR A FULL 4 WEEKS AFTER THE DATE OF YOUR SURGERY TO AVOID INFECTION. SWELLING / INFLAMMATION CONTROL \u25cf Elevate your leg for the first 3-5 days. Do not place a pillow under your knee. Instead, place a pillow under your calf and ankle, with your knee kept straight. \u25cf Icing the surgical site is very important following surgery. In most cases you will be offered a cryotherapy unit to use after surgery. This unit is a cooler which circulates cold water through a cuff. This device may be left on the surgical site for extended periods of time. There is a rental fee to use this device, or it may be purchased directly. For any questions regarding this equipment please call East Coast Orthotics at 212-342-0846. \u25cf If you choose to use regular ice packs, please limit icing to 20-minute sessions every 2-3 hours at most to avoid any skin problems. \u25cf Icing the surgical site is very important following surgery. \u25cf In addition to icing, compression with a support/wrap and elevation of the affected limb above the level of your heart will promote good circulation and reduce both swelling and pain. \u25cf It is normal to have swelling and/or bruising around your incisions, or about the surgical extremity after surgery. This will gradually resolve after surgery. \u25cf PROLONGED FEVER OVER 102 DEGREES, THICK DRAINAGE, CHEST PAIN, SHORTNESS OF BREATH, OR CALF PAIN SHOULD BE REPORTE",

      "text_content": "Discharge Instructions: Knee Arthroscopy and Meniscus Repair Brace / Crutches / Weightbearing: \uf0a8 Meniscus Repair: Weight bearing as tolerated in brace, locked in extension while walking \uf0a8 Meniscus Repair: Non-weight bearing, brace locked in extension at all times \uf0a8 Cartilage Repair: Non-weight bearing, brace locked at all times \u2022 If you are non weight bearing, you must use crutches to avoid bearing weight on your injured leg. \u2022 Wear the brace while sleeping until further instructed. \u2022 Only remove the brace when at physical therapy or doing home exercises, ROM 0-90 degrees only for 6 weeks. Wound Care: \u2022 Remove Ted hose and soft dressings in 3 days. \u2022 Do not get your dressing or brace wet. \u2022 After your top dressings are removed (Day 3), you may shower normally unless otherwise directed by Dr. Stapleton. o Do not scrub incision or scrub/remove skin glue. Allow soapy water to run over your incisions and pat dry with a clean towel. \u2022 Do not submerge your incisions underwater (bath, swimming pool, etc.) until fully healed (typically around 4 weeks). \u2022 There are no sutures to remove, they are beneath your skin and will dissolve over time. Diet: \u2022 Begin with clear liquids and light food (jello, toast, etc.) \u2022 Progress to your normal diet if you are not nauseated. Cryotherapy / Ice: \u2022 Use ice packs or cryotherapy often for several weeks after surgery and after therapy sessions. \u2022 Apply ice for 20 minutes every 2 hours while awake. \u2022 Ice or cold pack should never be applied directly on the skin as this may cause frostbite. A cloth or towel should always be used between the skin and ice pack to protect the skin. \u2022 You may consider purchasing a commercially available ice and compression device available online (e.g., amazon.com). Some options include a NICE Machine, Game Ready machine or Cryocuff. These devices are not always covered by insurance; please contact your insurance company for cost details. If desired, Dr. Stapleton can write you a prescription for these devices. 1 Activity: \u2022 Follow specific weight bearing and activity restrictions on page 1. \u2022 Knee brace will be worn for 2-6+ weeks when ambulating, Dr. Stapleton will discuss your results individually \u2022 Elevate the operative leg above your heart as often as possible for 5 days after surgery to help decrease post-operative swelling. \u2022 Carefully follow brace guidelines after surgery until your follow up appointment with Dr. Stapleton. \u2022 Take frequent short walks with crutches to help promote blood flow in your legs and minimize the risk of blood clots. \u2022 Do not drive while on narcotic pain medication. Do not make important decisions or sign any legal documents while on narcotic pain medication. \u2022 Do not drive until cleared by your physician. Physical Therapy: \u2022 Formal physical therapy will be ordered by Dr. Stapleton at your first post-op appointment. Begin these home exercises the day after your surgery. 2 Pain / Medications \u2022 You have been given a nerve block prior to your surgery to reduce post-operative pain. This will usually wear off in the evening following your surgery. \u2022 Take a pain pill as soon as you begin to regain feeling in your foot or leg after surgery, before the block wears off. \u2022 It is easier to maintain pain control if you stay ahead of the pain. It is difficult to catch up with your pain if it gets too severe. \u2022 Expect to have pain following surgery. Pain level of 4-5/10 is our goal. The pain medications prescribed by Dr. Stapleton should provide relief, but often does not take all the pain away. The first few days after surgery are often the most painful. Your pain will improve with time. \u2022 Please use narcotic medications (Tramadol) sparingly and slowly try to decrease the amount and frequency over the next two weeks. \u2022 Constipation is common after surgery due to pain medication and lack of activity. Consider taking a stool softener such as Miralax or Colace as needed. Continue all medications you were taking before surgery in addition to the medications Dr. Stapleton prescribed below. Narcotic Pain Medication \u2022 You have been prescribed a narcotic pain medication. (cid:127) Oxycodone 5mg by mouth every 6-8 hours as needed for pain. Non-narcotic Pain Medication \u2022 In addition to your narcotic medication, you should also take: (cid:127) Tylenol 1,000 mg every 6 hours. Do not exceed 4,000mg of Tylenol per day. (cid:127) Ibuprofen 600 mg every 8 hours for additional pain control. \u25aa Take this medication with food to help avoid stomach upset. Blood Thinner \u2022 You have been prescribed a medication to help prevent blood clots in your legs after surgery (medication indicated below). It is very important for you to take this medication as directed. (cid:127) Aspirin 81mg (Enteric Coated) - Take one pill by mouth two times per day for 30 days. (cid:127) Xarelto 10mg - Take one pill by mouth each day for 14 days. 3 (cid:127) Eliquis 2.5mg \u2013 Take one pill by mouth two times per day for 14 days.

Please be aware of possible dizziness and exercise caution when you are up. A responsible adult must be with the patient for 24 hours following surgery for safety and falls prevention. \u2022 Begin with liquids, and advance diet as tolerated; avoid greasy and spicy foods. \u2022 No important decisions or signing of legal documents for 24 hours. Do not operate power machinery. \u2022 Do not drive for 24 hours following surgery or while taking narcotic pain medications. \u2022 No alcoholic beverages for 24 hours, or while taking narcotics. \u2022 If you are unable to urinate, feel uncomfortable, and it has been 8-10 hours since you last urinated, go to an urgent care or the ER. \u2022 If you had a block, be sure to start your oral pain medication before it begins to wear off. Nerve Block: \u2022 If you have had a nerve block, be sure to start taking your pain medication before the block begins to wear off. \u2022 Typically, a nerve block will last between 8-24 hours from the time of injection. Notify your surgeon if the nerve block lasts more than 48 hours. \u2022 Do not use your operative extremity until the nerve block has worn off. Then, follow your surgeon\u2019s activity restrictions. Activity: \u2022 Keep your leg elevated with a pillow under your calf or ankle, not under the knee. \u2022 Keep your operative extremity at or above the level of your heart for the first 2-3 days. This is the best position to reduce swelling. \u2022 You may put full weight on your operative leg with the brace locked in extension. You may move your knee from 0-90 degrees when not standing or walking \u2022 Use crutches and wear your knee immobilizer when walking. Brace: \u2022 Wear the immobilizer at all times (even when sleeping), except for showering and physical therapy exercises until your surgeon tells you different. \u2022 It is likely that the brace will not fit as well after dressing is removed. If so, feel free to adjust the straps accordingly. If you have trouble with this, feel free to ask your physical therapist for assistance or contact our office at 952-456-7010 for help. Physical Therapy: Make an appointment for the next 3-7 days. Dressing: \u2022 Keep your dressing dry and intact as instructed. \u2022 Your knee has an abundant amount of gauze/dressing on it. Do not be alarmed if range of motion feels limited secondary to this while the dressing is still on. \u2022 You may remove dressing in 48 hours. You may remove the ace bandage, gauze, and yellow antibiotic film. Please leave steri-strips in place until your two week post op appointment, or until they fall off on their own. \u2022 Wait to shower until initial surgical dressing is removed. Pat area dry with a clean towel after showers. \u2022 Do not submerge your knee in water (bathtub, hot tub, pool, etc.) until your incisions healing has been cleared by your surgeon\u2019s office for these activities. Ice: \u2022 For 6 weeks: at least 3 times/day for 20 minute. Do not exceed 20 minute increments. Leave at least 30 minutes in between icing sessions to avoid frost bite. Pain/Medications: \u2022 Expect to have pain following surgery. Pain level of 4-5/10 is our goal. The pain medication prescribed for you should provide relief, but often does not take all the pain away. The first few days following surgery can be the most painful. Just remember, it will get better. \u2022 It is important to keep your pain under control. It is difficult to catch up with your pain if it becomes severe. \u2022 Resume your preoperative medications per your physician. Refer to your medication list given to you at discharge. DVT Prevention: \u2022 Blood clots are at a higher risk of developing in the leg after having orthopedic surgery and when your activity is limited following any surgical procedure. \u2022 We can reduce the risk of this rare complication from surgery giving you Aspirin for two weeks after surgery \u2022 This medication is NOT for pain control, but specifically for prevention against developing blood clots after surgery and must be taken as scheduled. Office Return: \u2022 Please call the office (952-456-7000) on the first day or two after surgery to schedule a 2 week post- operative visit if it has not already been arranged. Most likely, it has already been arranged. Report to Surgeon any of the following: \u2022 Fever over 101 degrees for more than 24 hours \u2022 Foul drainage, redness, or warmth at the operative site \u2022 Large amount of bleeding or drainage \u2022 Severe and uncontrolled pain \u2022 Persistent nausea or vomiting \u2022 Hives, rash or intolerance (Stop medications) Who to Contact \u2022 Contact information for Dr. Wulf: o Kristine Zwieg, PA-C o Jill Weinzettel \u2013 Care Coordinator \u00a7 952-456-7010 \u2022 Our Orthopedic Urgent Care is available 7 days a week from 8 AM to 8PM, and can assist afterhours or on weekends should you need to be seen by an orthopedic provider.

DIET \u2022 Begin with clear liquids and light foods (jello, soups, etc.) \u2022 Progress to your normal diet if you are not nauseated WOUND CARE \u2022 Maintain your operative dressing, loosen bandage if swelling of the foot and ankle occurs \u2022 It is normal for the knee to bleed and swell following surgery. If blood soaks onto the ACE bandage, do not become alarmed, reinforce with additional dressing \u2022 To avoid infection, keep surgical incisions clean and dry for the first 7 days following surgery \u2013 you may shower by placing a large plastic bag over your brace beginning the day after surgery. NO immersion of the operative leg (ie: bath or pool). \u2022 Wait until your first post operative appointment to have Dr. Garcia\u2019s team remove the surgical dressing \u2022 Please do not place any ointments lotions or creams directly over the incisions. \u2022 Once the sutures are removed at least 7-10 days post operatively you can begin to get the incision wet in the shower (water and soap lightly run over the incision and pat dry). NO immersion in a bath until given approval by our office. MEDICATIONS \u2022 Local anesthetics are injected into the wound and knee joint at the time of surgery. This will wear off within 8-12 hours and it is not uncommon for patients to encounter more pain on the first or second day after surgery when swelling peaks. \u2022 Most patients will require some narcotic pain medication for a short period of time \u2013 this can be taken as per directions on the bottle. \u2022 Common side effects of the pain medication are nausea, drowsiness, and constipation. To decrease the side effects take the medication with food. If constipation occurs, consider taking an over the counter laxative and be sure to drink plenty of water. \u2022 If you are having problems with nausea and vomiting, contact the office to possibly have your medications changed. \u2022 Do not drive a car or operate machinery while taking the narcotic medication \u2022 Please avoid alcohol use while taking narcotic pain medication \u2022 If you are having pain that is not being controlled by the pain medication prescribed, you may take an over the counter anti-inflammatory medication such as ibuprofen or naproxen in between doses of pain medication. This will help to decrease pain and decrease the amount of narcotic medication required. Please take as directed on the bottle. \u2022 For 2 weeks following surgery take one aspirin 325mg tablet daily to lower the risk of developing a blood clot after surgery. Please contact the office should severe calf pain occur or significant swelling of the calf or ankle occur. ACTIVITY \u2022 Elevate the operative leg to chest level whenever possible to decrease swelling. \u2022 Do not place pillows under knees (i.e. do not maintain knee in a flexed or bent position), but rather place pillows under the foot/ankle. \u2022 Due to the nature of the meniscal repair, you will be Touch Down Weight Bearing for balance (ie non weight bearing with crutches but only resting the foot on the ground for balance) for 2-4 weeks post operatively \u2022 Do not engage in activities which increase knee pain/swelling (prolonged periods of standing or walking) for the first 7-10 days following surgery. \u2022 Avoid long periods of sitting (without leg elevated) or long distance traveling for 2 weeks. \u2022 NO driving until instructed otherwise by physician \u2022 May return to sedentary work ONLY or school 3-4 days after surgery, if pain is tolerable BRACE \u2022 Your brace should be worn fully extended (straight) at all times (day and night \u2013 except for exercises) until otherwise instructed after the first post-operative visit. ICE THERAPY \u2022 Icing is very important in the initial post-operative period and should begin immediately after surgery. \u2022 Use icing machine continuously or ice packs (if machine not prescribed) for 30-45 minutes every 2 hours daily until your first post-operative visit \u2013 remember to keep leg elevated to level of chest while icing. Care should be taken with icing to avoid frostbite to the skin. \u2022 You do not need to wake up in the middle of the night to change over the ice machine or icepacks unless you are uncomfortable EXERCISE \u2022 Begin exercises 24 hours after surgery (straight leg raises, quad sets, heel slides, and ankle pumps) unless otherwise instructed. \u2022 Discomfort and knee stiffness is normal for a few days following surgery. It is safe to bend your knee in a non-weightbearing position when performing exercises unless otherwise instructed. Avoid flexing past 90 degrees \u2022 Complete exercises 3-4 times daily until your first post-operative visit \u2013 your motion goals are to have complete extension (straightening) and 90 d",

Cancienne, M.D. Midwest Orthopaedics at Rush Sports Medicine Joliet Office Shoulder, Hip, Knee Arthroscopy 963 129th Infantry Dr. Joliet, IL 60435 Shoulder Replacement Surgery Midwest Orthopaedics at Rush Naperville Office 55 Shuman Blvd Suite 700. Naperville, IL 60563 Liesl Giermann, Secretary 708-492-5964 DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS & PHYSICAL THERAPY PROTOCOL: Arthroscopic Meniscus Repair \uf076 Recovery after knee surgery entails controlling swelling and discomfort, healing, return of range-of- motion of the knee joint, regaining strength in the muscles around the knee joint, and a gradual return to activities. The following instructions are intended as a guide to help you achieve these individual goals and recover as quickly as possible after your knee surgery. \uf076 COMFORT o Elevation \uf0a7 Elevate your knee and ankle above the level of your heart. The best position is lying down with a pillow under your calf and ankle. Do not place pillows directly under your knee as this allows the knee to rest in a bent position. Maintain the leg straight when resting. This should be done for the first several days after surgery. o Cold Therapy \uf0a7 If you elected to receive the circulating cooling device, this can be used continuously for the first 3 days, (while the initial post-op dressing is on). After 3 days, the cooling device should be applied 3 times a day for 20-30 minute intervals. \uf0a7 If you elected to receive the gel wrap, this may be applied for 20 minutes on, 20 minutes off as needed. You may apply this over the post-op dressing. Once the dressing is removed, be sure to place a barrier (shirt, towel, cloth, etc.) between your skin and the gel wrap. \uf0a7 If you elected to use regular ice, this may be applied for 20 minutes on, 20 minutes off as needed. You may apply this over the post-op dressing.

Activites & Advice for in the Hospital and while at Home 1. Please call with any concerns: 617-726-6648 2. Apply ice to the shoulder as it will be quite helpful. After two days, you can change the dressing to a smaller one to allow the cold to better get to the shoulder. Be sure to leave the little pieces of tape (steri-strips) in place. 3. Remove the sling on the first day after surgery. Move your elbow, wrist, hand and fingers several times a day. Begin the pendulum exercises several times a day. Put the sling back on when you\u2019re done with these exercises. It is likely the sling will be used for 2 weeks, unless instructed otherwise by Dr. Price. 4. If you had a purely arthroscopic procedure, it is okay to shower and get the wound wet after two days, but do not soak the wound as you would in a bath tub or hot tub. If you had and open procedure it will be necessary to keep the wound(s) dry for two weeks. 5. It is important to look out of signs of infection following surgery. These can include: fever (temperature > 101.50, chills, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, redness around your incision, or yellow or green drainage from your incision. Should any of these be present please contact Dr. Price\u2019s office immediately. 6. To wash under your operated arm bend over at the waist and let the arm passively swing away from the body. It is safe to wash under the arm in this position. 7. DO NOT lift the arm or move the arm at your shoulder using your muscles. This could damage the repair. 8. After shoulder surgery there is a variable amount of pain and swelling. This will dissipate after several days. Continue to take the pain medicine you were prescribed as needed. Remember it is called pain control, not pain elimination. 9. You will have an office visit with Dr. Price scheduled approximately 10-14 days after your surgery. www.massgeneral.org/orthopaedics/sports-medicine/doctors-and-staff/dr-price.page 1 Phase I: Immediate Postop Phase (first 5-7 days after surgery, prior to starting PT) Goals: 1. Protect the surgical site 2. Ensure wound healing 3. Diminish pain and inflammation 4. Prevent stiffness and regain motion Activities: 1. Sling: Use your sling all of the time except for when doing therapy. Remove the sling 4 or 5 times a day to do pendulum exercises. You will need to sleep with your sling and pillow in place. It is often more comfortable to sleep in a recliner or on several pillows. 2. Use of the affected arm: You may use your hand on the affected arm in front of your body but DO NOT raise your arm or elbow away from your body. It is all right for you to flex your arm at the elbow. Continue to move your elbow wrist and hand to help circulation and motion. Also: a. No lifting of objects b. No excessive shoulder extension c. No excessive stretching of sudden movements d.

This includes chewing gum, candy, and mints. No smoking or use of tobacco products. \u2022 You will need to obtain crutches if you don\u2019t already have them. Bring them with you the day of surgery. \u2022 Stop all blood thinners 1 week prior to surgery, unless directed otherwise. This includes coumadin, aspirin, and anti-inflammatories such as ibuprofen, Aleve, and Ibuprofen. You may use acetaminophen for pain. \u2022 Stop all herbal supplements 1 week prior to surgery. \u2022 Plan to spend approximately 8-10 hours at the surgical facility. \u2022 Arrange for someone to drive you home and stay with you through the night. \u2022 If you don\u2019t already have a post-op appointment for 4-7 days after surgery, call the office to schedule one at (913) 381-5225. Dr. Robert P. Bruce, MD If you have any questions, please call: (913) 381-5225 Corporate Medical Plaza Lee\u2019s Summit Office Building #1 3151 NE Carnegie Dr. 10171 Nall Ave., Suite 200 Suite B Overland Park, KS 66211 Lee\u2019s Summit, MO 64064 POST-OPERATIVE INSTRUCTIONS \u2022 To decrease swelling, elevate your leg above heart level whenever you can. Pointing and flexing your foot as well as doing ankle circles will help with swelling also. If your knee swells it may cause the ace bandage to become too tight, causing swelling in the ankle. You may unwrap the ace bandage, then rewrap so that it fits snugly. \u2022 You will have a polar care unit incorporated into your dressing. It uses a continuous flow of cold water passing through a pad over your incision to provide comfort and reduce swelling. Use this continuously for the first 48 hours and then as frequently as needed for comfort. You should also use the polar care after therapy. \u2022 Keep dressing on and dry until your follow up appointment with Dr. Bruce in 4-7 days. If you do not already have an appointment scheduled, please contact (913) 381-5225. \u2022 Use your crutches to get around as needed. You may progress to full weight bearing on the affected leg over the first 2-3 weeks after surgery as tolerated, unless otherwise instructed by the doctor. If you have a meniscus repair, you will be required to remain on crutches for six weeks non-weight bearing. All range of motion exercises will begin as normal but no weight bearing. \u2022 Take the anti-inflammatory medication as prescribed to you. \u2022 Take the pain medication on an as needed basis only. Be aware that a common side effect of some pain medications is constipation. It is important to remain well hydrated and include fiber in your diet. You may use an over the counter stool softener or laxative if necessary. \u2022 Start slowly with your diet, progressing from clear liquids to a regular diet. Avoid heavy or greasy foods the first 24 hours after surgery. \u2022 Early motion is very important after ACL reconstruction. After surgery you will have a hinged knee brace on which will be locked in straight extension at 0\u02da. You may move the dial on either side of the brace from the locked position to 0\u02da with flexion set at 90\u02da. This will allow you to bend your knee and begin range of motion as well as to begin to put some pressure on your leg as you walk with your crutches. When you go to bed, put the dial back on the locked position at 0\u02da. \u2022 Remember to do the range of motion exercises listed in this brochure as soon as you leave the recovery room and continue to do them 3 times per day until you see Dr. Bruce in the office. \u2022 While doing range of motion exercises it is important to emphasize full extension of the affected leg as well as flexion. If you cannot reach full extension you may place a weight on your knee over the patella to assist with extension. \u2022 Dr. Bruce may give you a prescription for formal physical therapy (PT) to begin prior to your first post-op visit. Please call our office and ask for the Insurance Department at ext. 320, 321, or 322 to find out about insurance authorization and location. Dr. Robert P.

QUAD SETS Tighten front thigh muscle (quadriceps) by trying to push the back of the knee to the floor. Repeat 25 times 3 times per day. 2. STRAIGHT LEG RAISES Tighten your thigh muscle and lift your leg 8-12 inches. Hold 4-6 seconds. Slowly lower your leg. Repeat 10 times 3 times per day. 3. HEEL SLIDES Go ahead and BEND your knee, it will get stiff if you keep it straight all the time. You may do heel slides, or sit in a chair and let your knee bend. Repeat 15 times 3 times per day. 4.

      "text_content": "Post-operative Instructions for Shoulder Arthroscopy with Rotator Cuff Repair Dr. Jeffrey J. Mair, DO PAIN: \uf0b7 You will be sent home from the surgery center with prescriptions for pain medication. \uf0b7 After the first day or two, as the pain lessens, you may decrease the frequency with which you take the medication. \uf0b7 Remember, the medications are not necessarily meant to completely eliminate your pain, only to make it more bearable. \uf0b7 It is also helpful to use ice to decrease pain and swelling. \uf0b7 If these measures are not adequately controlling your pain, please call our office. \uf0b7 If it is after hours, you will speak to the physician on call. \uf0b7 Narcotic pain medications can cause constipation; you may wish to use an over-the- counter stool softener to help prevent this. DRESSINGS: \uf0b7 You will have a soft dressing applied over your incisions. \uf0b7 It is meant to absorb any leaking blood or fluid from the joint, and to protect from infection. \uf0b7 Leakage immediately after surgery is normal and actually helps to drain some of the fluid that accumulates in the joint during surgery. \uf0b7 The dressings may become moist or blood-stained; this is normal and usually not a cause for alarm. BATHING: \uf0b7 You may remove your dressing 48 hours after your surgery to take a shower. \uf0b7 You may let soap and water gently wash over your incisions, but do not scrub them. \uf0b7 Pat them dry with a towel, then recover each of the incisions with a band-aid. \uf0b7 You may not soak in a bathtub or go swimming until your sutures have been removed and your incisions are well healed. \uf0b7 You should remove your sling/immobilizer to shower, but if you had a repair, you must keep your arm at your side. SLEEPING: \uf0b7 It may be helpful to sleep in a recliner initially after your surgery. \uf0b7 This position is often more comfortable at first, helps to \u201celevate\u201d the shoulder, and will help prevent you from moving around too much while you are sleeping. \uf0b7 You may transition to a bed as soon as it is comfortable to lie in a more flat position. \uf0b7 You may need to use pillows to prop yourself up slightly as you are making this transition. \uf0b7 It may be anywhere from a few days to a week or two before you are able to sleep comfortably in a bed. DRIVING: \uf0b7 You may not drive while you are taking pain medications. \uf0b7 Once you have discontinued the pain medications, your doctor will let you know when it is safe to drive depending on your specific procedure. AFTER SURGERY: \uf0b7 Your arm should remain in the shoulder sling/immobilizer at all times; although you may remove it to shower, and a few times a day to bend and straighten your elbow and wrist as long as your arm stays at your side. 10-14 DAYS POST-OP: \uf0b7 You will have your first office visit. \uf0b7 If you have non-absorbable sutures, they will be removed at this visit. \uf0b7 You will review surgical pictures and be given the opportunity to ask questions. \uf0b7 You may be taught gentle pendulum exercises to help decrease the development of stiffness, which you should do 2-3 times daily. \uf0b7 Continue wearing the sling/immobilizer the remainder of the time. 4-6 WEEKS POST-OP: \uf0b7 At this time, you will begin physical therapy to help improve your range of motion. \uf0b7 Once therapy starts, you will be allowed to discontinue the sling/immobilizer and begin moving the arm on your own. \uf0b7 It will be stiff and sore and fatigue easily, so you may need to wean out of it slowly over a few days. \uf0b7 You still should not lift anything heavier than a glass of water or plate of food. 8-12 WEEKS POST-OP: \uf0b7 You will have follow-up office visits every 4-6 weeks until fully healed. \uf0b7 You may continue to use your arm for daily activities, but should not lift more than a few pounds. \uf0b7 Strengthening begins with light weights and increases slowly with the help of your physical therapist. 3-4 MONTHS POST-OP: \uf0b7 You will likely finish physical therapy, but should continue with your home exercises to improve range of motion, strength, and function. 6 MONTHS POST-OP: \uf0b7 If things have progressed as expected, you will likely be able to resume most activities as tolerated. \uf0b7 Be aware that, for some people, it may actually be a year or more after surgery before you have full motion and strength. \uf0b7 Many patients will have a final office visit between six months and one year post-op, depending on your recovery progress and the size of your tear.",

These should be left in place for 3 days. Due to the large amount of fluid used during arthroscopy, it is normal to see some bloody drainage on the dressings. If bright red blood soaks through the dressings, please call Dr. Palsis\u2019s office. After 3 days, the dressing can be removed and wounds covered with dry gauze or waterproof Band-Aids. Do not remove the paper tapes/strips or cut any of the visible sutures. Showering: Unless otherwise instructed, you may shower 2 days after surgery, but you must keep the dressing/wounds dry. Do not soak the operative shoulder (no baths, hot-tubs, or pools) for 4 weeks or until allowed by Dr. Palsis to avoid risk of infection. Ice Therapy: Icing is very important for the first 5-7 postoperative days to decrease swelling and pain. While the postoperative dressing is in place, icing can be continuous. Once the dressing is removed on the third operative day, ice can be applied for 15-20 minute periods, 3-4 times per day. Care must be taken with icing to avoid frostbite to the skin. Sleep: Sleeping can be uncomfortable for the first 1-2 weeks after shoulder surgery. It can be helpful to sleep in a recliner-chair or in a semi-upright position or with pillows under the elbow. Activity: Unless otherwise instructed, you should begin the pendulum and gentle passive range-of- motion exercises on the first day after surgery. You may use your arm to assist with eating and personal hygiene unless specifically instructed not to by Dr. Palsis. You may not bear weight or lift anything heavier than a cell phone or cup of coffee with your operative arm. Be sure to use and move your hand, wrist, and elbow in order to decrease swelling in your arm. While exercise is important, don\u2019t overdo it. Common sense is the rule. Sling/Immobilizer: Unless otherwise instructed, you should wear your postoperative sling/immobilizer at all times, including while sleeping. The sling can be taken off for showering; however, care must be taken to protect the shoulder at all times. Postoperative Instructions \u2014 Shoulder Arthroscopy Medications: \u2022 Pain Control: For most patients, a nerve block is provided by the anesthesia team before surgery to help with postoperative pain control \u2013 while every patient is different, this will typically wear off within 12-24 hours. Most patients will require some narcotic pain medication (e.g., Vicodin, Norco, Percocet, or other codeine-derivative) for 1-3 days after surgery \u2013 please take as instructed. It is important not to drink alcohol or drive while taking narcotic medication. If your pain is minimal, you may discontinue the use of narcotics. Ibuprofen (Advil) 400-800 mg can be taken as needed in between doses of narcotic pain medication for additional pain control. \u2022 Nausea: The anesthetic drugs used during your surgery may cause nausea for the first 24 hours. Some patient will require anti-nausea medication (e.g., Zofran, Phenergan) for 1-3 days after surgery\u2014please take as instructed. If nausea and vomiting become severe, or if you show signs of dehydration (lack of urination), please call Dr. Palsis\u2019s office. \u2022 Constipation: The use of narcotics can lead to constipation. Adequate hydration and over- the-counter stool softeners (e.g., docusate) can minimize constipation problems. \u2022 Normal Medications: Resume the day after surgery unless otherwise instructed. Diet: Following surgery, begin with clear liquids and light foods. You can progress to your normal diet if not nauseated. Postoperative Appointment: Dr. Palsis will need to reexamine you 10-14 days after your procedure. Please call the office at (321) 361-5550 to schedule a follow-up appointment if not already scheduled. Driving: No driving until permitted by Dr. Palsis. Work/School: May return to sedentary work or school 3-4 days after surgery, if pain is tolerable. Phone Numbers and Other Helpful Information: \u2022 A low-grade fever (up to 100.5 degrees) is not uncommon in the first 48 hours. Please call Dr. Palsis\u2019s office with any temperature over 101.3 degrees. \u2022 Please call Dr. Palsis\u2019s office if you have severe pain that your pain medication does not relieve, persistent numbness of the hand, fever over 101.3 degrees, redness/warmth around the incision(s), persistent drainage/bleeding from the incision(s), difficulty breathing, chest pain, excessive nausea/vomiting, or if you experience redness or swelling in your thigh or calf. \u2022 If unexpected problems occur and you need to speak to someone, please call the doctor. If calling after office hours or on the weekend, call (321) 361-5550. \u2022 If you have an emergency that requires immediate attention, proceed to the nearest emergency room.",

      "text_content": "Discharge Instructions: Shoulder Arthroscopy (cid:127) Biceps Tenodesis (cid:127) Mumford Procedure (cid:127) Decompression Wound Care: \u2022 Remove your shoulder dressing (surface dressing) in 3 days. \u2022 Leave steri-strips (white tape) in place until they fall off or are removed at your first post-op visit. \u2022 You may shower 3 days after your surgery. Allow water to run over your incisions and gently pat dry. \u2022 A small amount of drainage is common and expected after shoulder surgery. Apply bandaids to incisions if needed. \u2022 Some swelling and bruising of the shoulder and upper arm can occur after surgery, this is normal. \u2022 Do not scrub or pick at your incisions. \u2022 Do not apply any lotions, ointments, or creams to your incisions unless directed to do so by Dr. Stapleton. \u2022 Do not submerge incisions underwater (bath, swimming pool, etc.) until fully healed (typically 4 weeks). \u2022 There are no sutures to remove, they are beneath your skin and will dissolve over time. Sling: \u2022 Wear your sling at all times except showering and exercises for the first 2 weeks after surgery. \u2022 Wear your sling while you sleep. The sling can be adjusted to your comfort, if needed. \u2022 Do not bear weight or use your arm to lift, carry, or pull anything until cleared by Dr. Stapleton \u2022 Remove the sling several times each day and straighten your elbow to prevent stiffness. \u2022 Wearing a sling can sometimes cause shooting pain and/or numbness and tingling in your hand after surgery. If you experience this, remove the sling and allow the arm to hang gently at your side for a few hours. This should help with the discomfort. Cryotherapy / Ice: \u2022 Use ice packs for 20 minutes every 2 hours while awake after surgery to help with pain and swelling. \u2022 Ice or cold pack should never be applied directly on the skin as this may cause frostbite. A cloth or towel should always be used between the skin and ice pack to protect the skin. \u2022 You may consider purchasing a commercially available ice and compression device available online (e.g., amazon.com). Some options include a NICE Machine, Game Ready machine, or Cryocuff. These devices are not always covered by insurance; please contact your insurance company for cost details. If desired, Dr. Stapleton can write you a prescription for these devices. 1 Pain / Medications \u2022 Nerve Block: you were administered a preoperative nerve block to reduce pain after surgery. \u2022 Start your oral pain medication before your block wears off. \u2022 It is easier to maintain pain control if you stay ahead of the pain. It is difficult to catch up with your pain if it gets too severe. \u2022 Expect to have pain following surgery. Pain level of 4-5/10 is our goal. The pain medications prescribed by Dr. Stapleton should provide relief, but often does not take all the pain away. The first few days after surgery are often the most painful. Your pain will improve with time. \u2022 Please use narcotic medications (Tramadol) sparingly and slowly try to decrease the amount and frequency over the next two weeks. \u2022 Do not make important decisions or sign any legal documents while on narcotic pain medication. \u2022 Constipation is common after surgery due to pain medication and lack of activity. Consider taking a stool softener such as Miralax or Colace as needed. Continue all medications you were taking before surgery in addition to the medications Dr. Stapleton prescribed below. Narcotic Pain Medication \u2022 You have been prescribed a narcotic pain medication. (cid:127) Tramadol 50mg by mouth every 6-8 hours as needed for pain. Non-narcotic Pain Medication \u2022 In addition to your narcotic medication, you should also take: (cid:127) Tylenol 1,000 mg every 6 hours. Do not exceed 4,000mg of Tylenol per day. (cid:127) Ibuprofen 600 mg every 8 hours for additional pain control. \u25aa Take this medication with food to help avoid stomach upset. Blood Thinner \u2022 You have been prescribed a medication to help prevent blood clots in your legs after surgery (medication indicated below). It is very important for you to take this medication as directed. (cid:127) Aspirin 81mg (Enteric Coated) - Take one pill by mouth two times per day for 30 days. 2 Diet: \u2022 Begin with clear liquids and light food (jello, toast, etc.) \u2022 Progress to your normal diet if you are not nauseated. Activity: \u2022 Avoid lifting your hand above your head or reaching out to the side with your operative arm. \u2022 It is common for the hand and wrist to swell from being immobilized in a sling after shoulder surgery o Elbow, wrist, and hand motion exercises can help reduce this pain and swelling. \u2022 Take frequent short walks to help promote blood flow in your legs and minimize the risk of blood clots. \u2022 Do not drive while on narcotic pain medication. \u2022 Do not drive until cleared by Dr. Stapleton to do so. Research shows driving performance is impaired for at least 6 weeks after surgery; patients should use caution when returning to the road. Physical Therapy: \u2022 Formal physical therapy will be ordered by Dr. Stapleton after y",

      "text_content": "DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS FOR SHOULDER ARTHROSCOPIC SURGERY Remember to re-read these after your surgery DRESSINGS: Shoulder dressings may be removed 24 hours after surgery for showering. You may cover the stitches with Band-Aids upon removing the larger bandage. It is normal to see bloody drainage on the bandages. SHOWERING: Showers are acceptable after the bandage has been removed. Do not however, use a bathtub, Jacuzzi or otherwise submerge the shoulder underneath water. After showering, gently pat the surgical area dry and re-apply the Band-Aids. SWELLING: It is common to experience temporary swelling around the shoulder and arm. This may include black and blue bruising in the chest and lower parts of the arm. To minimize swelling utilize an ice pack and practice moving the elbow, wrist and hand to \"pump the swelling\" out the arm. ICING Safe use of an ice pack contributes to pain relief and reduction in swelling. You can apply ice as often as needed on top of your dressing during the first postoperative day. After your dressing is removed, ice can be applied for 20-minute periods, 3-4 times per day. Please have a barrier between the ice pack and your skin to prevent frostbite. RELIEF OF PAIN: Most patients are prescribed the following medications. These medications may be used together and should be taken as instructed on the pharmacy bottle: Mobic \u2013 an anti-inflammatory (NSAID) to help relieve pain and swelling (please do not take and notify us if you have a sulfa allergy) Norco or Percocet \u2013 a narcotic pain medication (hydrocodone or oxycodone) combined with acetaminophen (generic form of Tylenol) Tylenol \u2013 may be used in place of pain medication (Norco/Percocet) for mild pain. Please note that the maximum daily dose of Tylenol is 4000 mg. ECASA \u2013 coated aspirin \u2013 ECASA 325 mg daily for 10 days may decrease the unlikely complication of blood clots (DVT) and pulmonary emboli. Early movement and mobilization may also decrease this risk.

NAUSEA & VOMITING: Although unusual, both can be experienced after anesthesia in surgery. If you have a tendency for this, please discuss it with the anesthesiologist. Otherwise it is usually alleviated with a clear liquid diet. ACTIVITIES: A sling has been provided to you and should be used for comfort throughout the first week. You may remove the sling several times per day to bend and straighten the elbow as well as perform hand exercises including opening and closing the fist. You will receive further instructions regarding use of the sling at your first postoperative appointment. POSTOPERATIVE OFFICE VISIT Your first post operative visit should already be arranged.

      "text_content": "SHOULDER ARTHROSCOPY DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS Raj Bazaz, MD (303) 321-1333 or Toll free 1-888-900-1333 (outside Denver) www.western-ortho.com 1. Dressing: You can change your surgical dressing 72 hours after surgery. Begin by removing the tape and all of the bulky padding. Keep all of the steri-strips in place over the incisions. This should remain in place until you return to our office for the first post- operative visit. If the steri-strips fall off, replace them with band-aids. 2. Showering: Although the adhesive dressings are in place over the incision sites, you must still protect them from getting wet for the first 10 days. You may shower 72 hours after the surgery, using plastic wrap over the shoulder to protect the dressing. Generally, the incision sites may get directly wet in a shower at 10 days and submerged in a bathtub, pool or jacuzzi at 3 weeks after surgery. 3. Swelling: The arthroscopic procedure involves filling up the shoulder joint with fluid. It is common to experience some swelling after surgery, but this fluid should be reabsorbed within the first few days after surgery. Ice can be used on your shoulder as often as you\u2019d like, until the bulky dressing is removed. Then ice can be applied every 20 minutes at a time as often as needed for pain and swelling. It will be helpful to use ice following your exercises and physical therapy. 4. Sling/Brace: If you were provided with a pillow sling, this should remain in place at all times other than for doing your exercises, bathing and dressing. It should remain in place until your physician tells you to discontinue its use. 5. Exercises: Exercises are an important part of your recovery. You can start your exercises the day after surgery, depending on your comfort. It is important to release your forearm from the sling in order to do the wrist, elbow and shoulder exercises. Squeezing a small ball is a helpful way to alleviate swelling and stiffness of the wrist and fingers. If these exercises produce significant pain, stop the exercises and check with your physician. Do not drive until your first post operative visit. Length of driving limitations will be further discussed then and depends on side (right vs. left) and type of surgery. What motions you can do at your shoulder, elbow, and wrist will be discussed before you leave the surgery center. 6. Pain Medications: You will be prescribed narcotic medication to be used after surgery at home. Keep in mind that narcotics will cause drowsiness and should not be used with alcohol. Also, taking these medications on an empty stomach can result in stomach upset. It is common to feel the most discomfort when lying down to sleep at night, so you may find it beneficial to take the pain pill at bedtime. If unusual side effects occur, please discontinue the medication and contact our office. When additional refills are needed, please contact our office during business hours. 7. Signs of Infection: With any surgery it is important to be aware of signs of infection which can include: unusual looking drainage (green/yellow), increased redness and tenderness around the incision site, or fever (101 degrees or above) and chills. It is a good idea to check the wound daily after the initial dressing change. Also, be aware of excessive bleeding, or prolonged numbness and tingling. Should any of these symptoms occur, contact our office as soon as possible. There is a physician on call 24 hours a day. 8. Post-Op Appointment: Post-operative appointment is required 7 to 10 days after your surgery; this can be done by calling (303) 321-1333. Activity and physical therapy will be discussed at this time. 9. D.V.T. Prophylaxis: Blood clots after shoulder arthroscopy are uncommon. Please wear TED stockings on both legs until 10 days post-op. Please take one (enteric coated aspirin) ECASA (325 mg) daily for 10 days post surgery. If you experience any signs or symptoms of D.V.T. such as leg swelling/pain, please notify us immediately. Any chest pain or shortness of breath is an emergency and please call 911. 10. Questions: If you have any additional questions, please contact our office. SLING USE INSTRUCTION You have been fitted for the Ultra-Sling for use after your surgery. You are to wear the sling 24 hours per day, including, while you are sleeping. The only time you may remove the sling is while you are showering or changing your clothes. Your doctor will instruct you when to stop wearing the sling. EXERCISES Exercises and movement are important after surgery. Completing your exercises as listed will assist in helping to speed the healing process and return you to your regular activities. The exercise ball attached to your sling is to be used throughout the day. Simply squeeze the ball with your hand repeatedly. This will help to decrease the swelling and pain. Prior to beginning the exercises, open the sling up, then begin the following exercises which are to be done 20 to 30 times each; 3 to 4 times per day: 1. Shrug Sh",

      "text_content": "SHOULDER ARTHROSCOPY DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS The following is an outline of instructions and information for post-operative shoulder arthroscopy with rotator cuff repair. Please follow these instructions specifically and if you have any questions, contact the Surgeon. The Arthroscopic Procedure Done on Your Shoulder Today 1. Shoulder Arthroscopy and Subacromial Decompression 2. Rotator Cuff Repair 3. _______________________________________________ 4. _______________________________________________ 1 Compliments of: Mobility Bone & Joint Institute Shoulder Arthroscopy Discharge Instructions Pain and Swelling It is completely normal to experience some postoperative pain and discomfort. The severity of the pain depends on the extent of the surgery and individuals pain tolerance. Several steps have been taken to decrease early postoperative pain. 1. The anesthesiologist has given you a nerve block (injection near your neck), to numb your shoulder and arm. This is to help control your pain. Therefore, it is normal to experience some numbness and tingling in your arm and fingers up to approximately 18 hours after surgery. The block typically lasts between 10-18 hours so do not wait for the block to completely wear off before starting your post op pain medication. 2. If you still have pain, you may take oral pain medications prescribed for you by the Surgeon. As stated before, do not wait for the block to wear off before starting your pain medications. 3. It is normal to have a fair amount of swelling in your shoulder after surgery. It may take 3-4 days for the fluid to be reabsorbed by your body. It is normal to see bruising and swelling down your arm from the effects of the surgical procedure. 4. You may experience a mild sore throat from anesthesia, nausea, and possibly low-grade fever (less than 101.5 degree Fahrenheit.) Ice You may use the cryo shoulder cuff that was prescribed prior to the surgery. Place this device over you shoulder with a barrier in between (towel, t-shirt) and use for the first 2 weeks usually 20 minutes on and 40 minutes off. Do this as frequently as up to 2 hours a day for the first week. DO NOT place the cooling device directly on the skin! Dressing Care You will wake up with a bulky dressing overlying your shoulder. Keep this dressing clean and dry. No showers for the first 48 hours. After 48 hours you can take this bulky dressing down to the steri-strips (tiny white strips over your incisions)- keep the strips on. They can get wet- pat dry with a clean towel. Steri-strips should be left on and they will naturally peel on their own and fall off usually around post op day 10-14. Any excessive bleeding that soaks the dressing should be reported to the Surgeon. Do not place ointments such as Neosporin, etc, on wounds. Bathing No Bathing for the first 48 hours. You may take down dressings after this period and steri-strips can get wet- pat dry with clean towel. No baths, hot tubs, pools for a minimum of 4 weeks after surgery. 2 Compliments of: Mobility Bone & Joint Institute Shoulder Arthroscopy Discharge Instructions Activity Sling: Should be worn at all times until further instructed by the Surgeon (typically will be worn full time for four to six weeks). This includes using it while sleeping. Formal physical therapy after surgery will be started per the Surgeon\u2019s instruction. Sling: Wear sling for comfort purposes. It is ok to come out of the sling to do motion exercises of the shoulder. Post- operative exercises: These should be performed for all procedures. 1. Pendulum Exercises: Take the sling off. Bend forward at the waist so your arm hangs down and make small, gentle circular motions with the arm as tolerated; 30 times clockwise and counter- clockwise, three times per day. 2. Hand, wrist and elbow range of motion exercises should be started the first day after surgery to prevent stiffness. 3. Outpatient PT referral will be given at your second post op visit at 6 weeks following surgery. Sleeping Most patients find sleeping in a reclining chair more comfortable until they are out of the sling. Place a pillow behind the elbow while lying down or sleeping. Driving No Driving is allowed while the shoulder sling is in place or until cleared by the Surgeon. You must be off all narcotic pain medications for a full 24 hours before driving.

      "text_content": "PATIENT INFORMATION Bunion Surgery - Metatarsal Osteotomy What is a bunion? (Hallux Valgus) A bunion, (Hallux Valgus) is a lump at the base of the big toe caused by sideways drifting and angulation of the big toe. A bunion is not a 'bump' on the bone; it is caused by angulation of the bones in the foot. Sometimes it is painful in itself, but more commonly it causes symptoms by pressure on shoe-wear, or on occasions by crowding or crossing the smaller (lesser) toes. The second toe can become so crowded that it becomes 'clawed,' and crosses over the big toe. 1st metatarsal What causes bunions? Bunions can occur gradually over time due to the way each foot absorbs force during walking. The bunion prominence is not due to any growth of bone but is due to the 1st metatarsal bone. With a bunion this has moved away from its immediate neighbour the 2nd metatarsal. This widens the forefoot thus producing the bunion. Most patients with bunions have a positive family history. Source: Trauma & Orthopaedics Reference No: 5419-1 Issue date: 01/03/2021 Review date: 01/03/2024 Page: 1 of 5 Is surgery the only way to treat bunions? Although bunions cannot be eliminated without surgery, they can be managed initially non- operatively. Shoes with a wide non constrictive toe box can be quite helpful in reducing the irritation over the prominent bunion as does wearing 'corn plasters' or 'pads'. Early and mild bunions may also respond to the application of insoles, splints, braces or toe spaces, although the effects are often short-lived. Some bunions are caused by flat foot and collapse of the arches. These can be helped by arch support shoe insoles. More severe bunions can only be corrected by surgery. Surgery should only be undertaken if the symptoms are significant and appropriate non-operative management has been considered. The surgery is usually carried out under a general anaesthetic, with local anaesthetic being used to reduce the amount of general anaesthetic required. Surgery is usually performed either as a day-case, or with an overnight stay in hospital. The type of operation chosen by your surgeon depends on the severity of the bunion, the shape of your foot, and other factors, such as if you have arthritis in the joint. An operation is usually successful at easing symptoms, but not in all cases. It is not always possible to relieve the pain completely or make the toe perfectly straight. Your specialist will be able to advise you on the pros and cons of surgery, and the success rate of the chosen operation. Continued pain, infection and recurrence of the bunion are some of the complications of surgery of which you need to be aware. How is the bunion corrected? Bunion surgeries involve an operation where the bone at the base of the toe (the metatarsal bone) is divided and replaced into the correct position. The bony bump is usually trimmed at the same time. The operation aims to strengthen the great toe, and narrow the forefoot. Because the operation involves dividing the bone, it has to be held in position while the bone heals together again. In the majority of cases small screws and or staples are used. Often the big toe is corrected as well, a procedure known as an 'Akin Osteotomy'. This procedure allows the bones of the big toe to be repositioned also. Most surgeries take about 1 hour to perform and can often be performed as a day case operation. Bones take a minimum of 6 weeks to heal. To protect the healing phase when mobilising, the foot is protected in a special post-operative shoe during this time. What can I expect after the operation? After the operation, your foot will be protected in a bandage which will remain in situ for the next 2 weeks. Your foot will swell following surgery and may be painful. In order to minimise swelling and reduce pain, you will need to keep your foot up after the operation and take regular pain killers(if required). You will be given a special shoe to wear after surgery. This should be worn at all times when mobilizing. At approximately 2 weeks you will attend clinic to have your foot assessed and any stitches removed. At approximately 6 weeks after your surgery you will attend clinic to be reviewed again. You may also have an x-ray of your foot. You may be discharged from further routine follow up at this appointment. What can I do once I am discharged from hospital? For the first two weeks you will need to rest your foot up most of the time. When the foot is lowered it will throb and swell causing pain. This should be avoided as much as possible. With time, the period you can keep the foot down will increase. At around two weeks after surgery, you will return to the clinic for removal of stitches. Two to three weeks after the operation you should be able to keep your foot down most of the time. After surgery, due to scar tissue, your toe may become stiffer. About 6 weeks after surgery it is important to exercise or mobilise the toe to reduce the risk of the toe remaining stiff",

      "text_content": "Patient Information Trauma and Orthopaedics Hallux valgus (bunion) This leaflet gives you information on the problems you may have with your big toe. It has sections on: \u2022 bunions \u2022 what you should know about bunions \u2022 your treatment options This leaflet is not a substitute for professional healthcare advice. It should be used along with verbal information given by a doctor. What is a hallux valgus? Hallux valgus is the medical name for a bunion. This is a condition where the big toe is angled towards the second toe. What are common causes of bunions? No single cause has been proven. They may be inherited or due to muscle imbalance. Certain footwear can make bunions worse. What are the symptoms? Bunions may not cause you any trouble. But sometimes they can cause: \u2022 pain, swelling and redness around the bunion \u2022 difficulty in walking due to discomfort \u2022 the foot to become wide, making it difficult to find shoes that fit \u2022 pain under the ball of foot, under the small toes Patient Information What are the treatment options? Non-surgical treatment One of the most important things you can do to help is to wear the right footwear. You should try to wear flat, wide shoes that fit you correctly. You may also want to use a bunion pad over the bunion, or a toe spacer, to give you protection from the pressure of your shoes. Do not wear high-heeled, pointed, or tight shoes. You can take painkillers, such as paracetamol or ibuprofen, to help relieve the pain and swelling of your bunion. Surgical treatment Surgery for bunions usually only happens after simple measures have failed to relieve your pain. Bunion surgery is not a cosmetic procedure. The main reason for surgery is pain caused by a bunion. The aim of surgery is to make the big toe straight, reducing the bump over the bunion The surgery involves a procedure to cut the bone, straighten it, and fix it in a new position. There are many different operations for the treatment of bunions and your surgeon will explain the best one for you. The most common bunion surgery is known as Scarf and Akin osteotomy. Scarf osteotomy A cut (incision) is made along the inner side of the bunion. A bony cut (osteotomy) is made in the first long bone of foot (metatarsal) leading to the big toe. This is repositioned to make it straighter and fixed in place by two small screws. The screws are buried in the bone. Usually, they do not need to be removed. Hallux valgus (bunion) www.uhcw.nhs.uk 2 Patient Information Akin osteotomy A further bony cut called an Akin osteotomy may be needed on the big toe at the same time. This is to straighten the big toe and avoid the big toe crossing under or over the 2nd toe. This involves removing a wedge of bone from the base of the big toe. The big toe is then realigned and fixed in position using a staple or screw. The aim is to achieve a straighter toe. The wound is closed with stitches which are usually dissolvable. There is usually no need for a plaster cast. But you will have a bulky dressing and will be provided with a special shoe afterwards. Above are pictures of where the cuts are made in the bones. The pictures then show where the screws and staple are inserted after the toe is realigned in its new position. Hallux valgus (bunion) www.uhcw.nhs.uk 3 Patient Information X-ray appearance before and after surgery before after side view after Smoking advice It is important that you give up smoking for at least 8 weeks before your surgery and up to 4 months afterwards. Evidence shows that people who smoke take longer for their bone to heal. If you smoke, you are 5 times more likely to develop non-union of the bone (bone not healing). You can get help from your GP or a smoking cessation helpline. Hallux valgus (bunion) www.uhcw.nhs.uk 4 Patient Information What can I expect after surgery? Swelling It is normal for your foot to swell after surgery. It may take up to 6 months for the swelling to go down. This depends on your general health and activity level. It is important to raise your foot above the level of your groin in the early stages. Pain It is usually painful for the first few weeks after surgery. In the first 6 months after bunion surgery, you may tend to walk on the outer border of your foot. This is to avoid putting weight through your big toe. Walking like this could cause some discomfort/pain under the ball of the other toes. Your pain and swelling will improve as the bone heals. Bleeding After surgery your wounds can bleed. If this happens, please contact the team providing your care (not your GP). They will invite you back to clinic for a wound assessment. If this occurs at the evening or weekend, please attend A&E if you are concerned. Scarring All surgery will leave a scar. These can sometimes be sensitive. It is recommended to massage your scar with E45 cream or Bio Oil from 3 weeks after surgery.

      "text_content": "Forefoot Deformity Correction: a guide to your recovery by Sam Singh This leaflet aims to answer your questions about having forefoot deformity correction surgery under the care of Mr Sam Singh. It explains the benefits, risks and alternatives, as well as what you can expect when you come to hospital. This leaflet covers surgery for Bunions, hammertoes and other non-arthritic forefoot deformities. For more information please go to Mr Singh\u2019s Website: http://www.footandanklesurgeon.co.uk What is forefoot deformity correction surgery? Most forefoot deformity surgery is to treat bunions (hallux valgus) and/or lesser/smaller toe deformities. What happens during forefoot deformity surgery? Forefoot deformity surgery can be done as a day surgery procedure, unless you have other significant medical problems that mean you may need to stay in hospital overnight, or if several toes are being corrected at the same time. You will usually have a general anaesthetic (be asleep). A cut is made over the bunion. The soft tissues around the bunion are released. The bunion is removed and a cut (osteotomy) is made in the long bone at the base of the big toe. This is repositioned and held in place with one or two screws or staples. The wound is closed with stitches. Usually these are dissolvable. Other procedures for the smaller toes may be performed at the same time through separate cuts over those toes. Occasionally these toes may need a temporary wire down the length of the toe to hold everything in the right place. The foot and ankle is then bandaged up. The screws in the big toe are small and usually can be left in forever. They are like internal scaffolding that holds the bones in the correct place and the bone mends around them. After that they are superfluous to needs but we leave them in as they seldom trouble you. The different types of bone cuts have different names that you may hear in clinic or when signing your consent form: \u2018Scarf osteotomy\u2019, \u2018Akin osteotomy\u2019. Why should I have forefoot deformity surgery? Surgery for bunions and lesser/smaller toe deformities usually only takes place after simple measures have failed to relieve the pain. These include wide fitting shoes, simple painkillers and padding. You must be realistic about the shoes you would like to wear. Even after the surgery, wearing high or medium heeled shoes may still be painful. What are the risks? In general, the risks of any operation relate to the anaesthesia and the surgical procedure itself. In most cases you will have a general anaesthetic. You will be able to discuss this with the anaesthetist before surgery and he/she will identify the best method for your individual case. The main surgical risks are listed below: (the full list of risks will be explained to you by your treating consultant Mr Sam Singh) Swelling: Your foot will swell after surgery as part of the response to surgery and the healing process. It may take more than 6 months for the swelling to go down. It is important to elevate your foot in the early stages. The foot will feel wider for these six months. Stiffness: The big toe may be stiffer than before surgery. For most people this is not a problem, although it may affect high performance athletes, dancers or wearing shoes with a very high heel. Gait: There can be a change to the way you walk (\u2018gait\u2019) as your big toe is back in alignment. Usually it improves your walking but it can cause pain in other areas of the foot. Infection: The cuts usually heal within two weeks, but may leak a small amount of fluid. In a small number of cases, the wounds may become infected and need antibiotics. Recurrence: Occasionally the deformity may recur and need further surgery. This is higher in younger patients, those with generalised laxity (looseness) of joints and those with more severe deformities. With more modern techniques significant recurrence is rare. Rarely the deformity is over corrected (Hallux Varus), it may not be symptomatic but if it is, it can be complex to treat. Pain: It is usually painful for the first week after surgery. After recovery, some patients experience pain under the heads of the smaller toes after bunion surgery as the weight is transferred this way (\u2018metatarsalgia\u2019). This is often helped with a simple shoe insole. A small number of patients may experience Chronic Regional Pain Syndrome, a disease characterised by severe pain, swelling, and changes in the skin, which may persist beyond the first few weeks following surgery. Scar: The scar on the inside of the foot usually fades with time but sometimes can become prominent especially in darker skinned individuals. Numbness: Sometimes the nerve supplying the inner edge or web space of the big toe can be damaged causing patches of numbness. This is not always permanent, although it may take six to twelve months to recover. Non-union: There is an approximately 1% chance that your bones will not heal together (unite). This may need further surgery but is usually man",

      "text_content": "Y B G OUR UNION UIDE \u201cI can\u2019t change the direction of the wind, but I can adjust my sails to always reach my destination \u2013 J. Dean Let\u2019s face it, we are often more like our parents than sometimes we wish to be, especially when it come to the shape and architectural makeup of our feet. This can especially be true when it comes to the formation of bunion (click here for video) deformities. A bunion typically appears as a large and painful bump on the side of the great toe which is often exaggerated by the big toe leaning towards the second toe. If you suffer from this kind of deformity you are not alone, as this can affect up to 30% of adults. But what really causes this deformity and is there anything that can be done to change it for the better? All about painful bunion deformities Although genetics do play an important role in our bone structure, it is not the only cause of bunions. While genetics often predispose us to the potential development of issues such as arthritis and deformities, bunion development is thought to be multi-factorial in nature. Environmental factors such as tight shoes, especially high heels or narrow dress shoes, the relaxation of ligaments as experienced during a pregnancy, or other structural abnormalities such as a flattened arch or inequality of the length of one\u2019s legs can lead to instability of the great toe joint which can cause the toe to move out of its normal alignment. Treatment of Bunion Deformities Is pain from your bunion affecting your quality of life? There are several ways to \u201cgrade\u201d a bunion, but perhaps the most important question you should ask is what kind of impact your deformity is having on your desired lifestyle? If you do not have any pain associated with your bunion but you simply do not like the way it looks, then it is strongly recommended that you avoid surgical correction as this is only cosmetic in nature and there can be no guarantees that you will achieve your desired result without some sort of post-operative discomfort. On the other hand, if your deformity is having a significant impact on your quality of life by not allowing you to participate in activities that you normally like to do, or the discomfort causes you to no longer enjoy those activities, then you are likely a great candidate to correct the underlying issues and restore your quality of life. Do I need surgery? While \u201cfixing\u201d a bunion deformity can only be accomplished through surgical reconstruction, there are several non-surgical options that are aimed to help to alleviate the symptoms associated with bunion deformities. These include wearing wider shoes with anatomic toe boxes, specialty shoe inserts or orthotics, bunion pads, and anti-inflammatory medication to reduce the swelling. Altra Running anatomic shoe box Shoes such as Altra Running (link) shoes have larger toe boxes to accommodate a foot that tends to be wider due to the bunion deformity. Other shoe manufactures, such as New Balance (link) and Brooks Running (link) also offer wider shoes that can accommodate special inserts or orthotic which can be really helpful. For more casual or dressier shoes you can look at Rockport (link) for both men and women. Shoe brands that are historically known for comfortable and functional footwear include Finn Comfort, Ecco, Dansko, Naot, Birkenstock, Mephisto, Born, and Clarks. Aravon dress sandals by Rockport Shoes If you have tried a lot of these modifications and have not found the relief you were looking for, than you may be a good candidate for surgical correction of your deformity. Are all bunion surgeries the same? The answer is a resounding no. By now, you have probably heard horror stories from friends or family members who have had surgery on their feet only to experience a less than desirable outcome and leading them to the conclusion that they wished they had never had the surgery in the first place. There are a lot of methods and techniques that surgeons use to \u201cfix\u201d bunions, but not all of them are created equally leading to a relatively large variance in outcomes which can include a high level of failure/recurrence rates. However, if the \u201ccorrect\u201d procedure is selected based on your desired outcome and expectations, bunion correction can lead to very predictable, long-term, and desirable outcomes. The correction of a painful bunion deformity can help you get back to the things that you love doing. The good news is that there have been huge advancements in innovative surgical techniques as of more recent, which has helped both surgeons and patients find a much higher level of satisfaction with surgical intervention and significantly improved long-term outcomes. In the past, most doctors would only \u201cshave\u201d the bump, which typically does nothing to address the underlying deformity and often results in a greater deformity.

A bunion is the lay term for hallux valgus, or deviation of the great toe. The deformity is complex and involves the big toe long bone (metatarsal) to deviate away (inward) from the second toe and the big toe itself to deviate outward, toward the second toe. Due to this movement, a prominence on the inside of the foot (the 'bunion') occurs and can cause symptoms. Contrary to popular belief, it is not a new growth of bone. A Typical Hallux Valgus (\u2018Bunion\u2019) Deformity What Causes Them? There are a number of causes including genetics, foot wear (high heels, narrow toe box), family history and inflammatory joint disorders (eg rheumatoid arthritis). Other causes have been implicated such as flat feet and lax ligaments. What Are The Symptoms? Most commonly pain around the bunion when wearing closed foot wear and a deformity that may get worse over time. Pain may also be experienced under the balls of the toes (metatarsalgia) or in the big toe joint. Normally wearing sandals or no shoes, relieves symptoms. Some patients with bunions have no symptoms at all. Will It Get Worse? Progression of the deformity usually occurs, but over what time period is difficult to predict. This can take years. David Gordon, Consultant Orthopaedic Surgeon \u2013 Hallux Valgus (\u2018Bunions\u2019): A Patient Guide Feb 2015 Hallux Valgus (\u2018Bunions\u2019) - A Patient Guide What Is The Treatment? If you have no discomfort or pain, then you do not need to do anything. If you have symptoms, there are a number of non surgical options you should try, before considering surgery: Modify or change your foot wear \u2013 The most important thing to do. A soft, wider shoe, with a small heel, which accommodates the foot well. Using a shoe stretcher, your current shoes may be made to fit. Bunion Pads\u2013Often made from silicon rubber, these protect the prominent area from rubbing. Silicon Spacers\u2013These can prevent toes rubbing if placed between the first and second toes. Surgery\u2013If non surgical options fail to resolve symptoms, then surgery can be considered. Bunion Pads (left and middle), Silicon Toe Spacer (right) What Does Surgery Involve? This will depend on the nature of the deformity you have. Mild, moderate and sometimes severe deformities can be corrected by an operation which involves releasing the tight tissues, cutting the big toe long bone (metatarsal osteotomy), shifting it back to its original position, then fixing it with 2 or 3 screws. Sometimes severe deformities or those with arthritis are better served with a fusion of the big toe joint. The operation can be performed as a Day Case procedure, under a local anaesthetic ankle block, making the whole foot numb for 6-12 hours. You can be awake, sedated or have a general anaesthetic during surgery, which takes about 45 minutes. Most patients do not experience significant pain after surgery with the modern techniques Mr Gordon uses. What is Minimally Invasive (Keyhole) Surgery? This is the standard technique Mr Gordon uses and most patients are suitable. The bunion correction is performed through 3 or 4 very small incisions, only a 3-4 millimetres long. This is in contrast to traditional surgery performed through large cuts on the foot. Mr Gordon offers this technique to private patients at The London Clinic, Spire Bushey Hospital, London and Spire Harpenden Hospital, Hertfordshire and The Luton & Dunstable NHS University Hospital. David Gordon, Consultant Orthopaedic Surgeon \u2013 Hallux Valgus (\u2018Bunions\u2019): A Patient Guide Feb 2015 Hallux Valgus (\u2018Bunions\u2019) - A Patient Guide What Are the Advantages of Minimally Invasive Bunion Correction Over Open Surgery? As smaller incisions are made, much less soft tissue stripping is required to gain access to the bone in order to make the bony corrections. This may lead to: Less joint stiffness Less internal scarring Less damage to tissues Minimal external scarring (no stitches needed) Day case surgery Quicker recovery time Faster return to work and normal activities Reduced surgical time Possibly a better result When is Open Bunion Correction Surgery Advised? For very severe deformities, or where bone quality is poorer in older age groups or for medical reasons, the traditional open Scarf Osteotomy can be performed. This is still a successful operation but has some drawbacks. What Happens After Surgery? Mr Gordon\u2019s evidence based Hallux Valgus Surgery Post Operative Rehabilitation Guide explains this in detail. What Are The Risks Of Bunion Correction Surgery? Although most surgery is complication free, there are risks involved. Below lists the most common first. Stiffness of the big toe joint\u2013It is likely you wi",

      "text_content": "Please bring this patient information booklet with you on the day of your operation Bunion correction surgery Information for patients What are the benefits of bunion correction surgery? The potential benefits from surgery are: \uf0b7 A reduction in pain \uf0b7 Improved alignment of the big toe, making the toe straighter \uf0b7 The bulkiness of the joint is removed, reducing the bump and therefore footwear is more comfortable. An improvement in these factors may also have a positive impact on your mobility and function. What are the risks? There are no guarantees regarding surgery. The success rate of surgery is about 80%. However, not all patients are satisfied with the outcome and a small number of patients are worse off (e.g. increased pain, stiff joint, negative impact on activities). There are specific risks with this type of operation and the outcomes are not always as expected. These risks have been detailed within this document and it is important that you read over these carefully before requesting an operation. There is a lengthy recovery following this type of operation. It will be 3 months before you return to usual activities. You will need to wear a special shoe for six weeks, you will be off work for six weeks, and you will be unable to drive for at least six weeks. Feedback from patients tells us it can be as much as one year after surgery before things settle down fully. Lastly, it is important for you to know that bunions can come back and footwear limitations will continue despite surgery. Are there alternatives to the surgery? If you decide not to have an operation, you can manage your symptoms by altering your activity levels, using painkillers, and changing footwear to extra width or special footwear possibly with a cushion-pad or in-shoe foot support. You should avoid high heels and shoes with a narrow toe. Can I do nothing? In general, this is not a life or limb threatening condition and surgery is not essential. Doing nothing is an option. Surgery can be done at anytime and we can continue to monitor your symptoms.

This booklet provides information on what to expect when you have bunion correction surgery. The information will help you to decide whether the planned treatment is the best option for you at this time. You will get the best outcomes by taking an active role in your care, by talking with your healthcare professional and planning ahead. Every individual is unique and this booklet provides general information. It is a guide, so that you can have an informed discussion with your surgical team. You, your family and friends should read this booklet carefully before surgery and refer to it during your healing process. You should consider the options available to you, including non-surgical management. Ask your surgical team to explain anything you do not understand. This will help if you are feeling a little worried. What are bunions? A bunion (medical term: hallux valgus) is a deformity of the big toe where there is an angle between the toe and the foot. This leads to widening of the foot and a prominence or bump over the joint causing problems with footwear, inflammation of the joint and pain. The big toe can start to crowd the other toes which may also become deformed (hammer/claw toes). Sometimes pain is experienced under the second toe \u201cknuckle\u201d joint. What causes bunions? The cause is usually hereditary and there may be a history of foot problems in your family. Shoes cause the symptoms (pain and irritation), rather than causing the actual bunion. Not everyone has problems with bunions. Problems are usually caused by shoes rubbing on the bump. Tight fitting shoes make the problem worse. Bunions are more common in women and more common in middle to later ages. Gout Sometimes pain and swelling in the big toe joint is caused by gout. Gout is a reaction to crystals forming in the joint. Gout is treated with medication (Allopurinol and anti- inflammatory drugs), not an operation. A blood test can help with the diagnosis of gout.

      "text_content": "Trigger Finger Release Post-op Instructions: Regional Plastic Surgery Center Wound Care: \uf095 After surgery, a bulky dressing will be placed on your hand and wrist. Your dressing should be kept clean and dry. The dressing can be removed 1-2 days after surgery, and the hand lightly cleaned with soap and water. The incision should not be soaked in water, such as in a bathtub, or vigorously rubbed to clean. You may dry the incision by patting it lightly with a clean, dry towel. A new, clean dressing should then be applied over the incision, such as a band aid. Dressings should be changed daily and as needed for any bleeding or drainage. \uf020 \uf095 The incision should be inspected daily, and any abnormal drainage or excessive bleeding should be reported immediately. \uf020 \uf095 Your sutures (if necessary) will be removed at your clinic visit, usually 10-14 days after surgery. There may be a superficial crack or separation at the incision line, which is normal. The outer layers of the callused palmar skin do not grow back together well, but the deeper tissues will. The separation on the skin will grow out with time and be flat.\uf020 \uf095 Pain and Swelling: \uf020 Elevate your hand to decrease swelling and discomfort. Mild to moderate swelling is expected after surgery. Your hand should be elevated above the level of your heart for best results. Local anesthesia has been used around the incision, which may cause numbness of the fingers and may last for hours up to a full day. Discomfort may return as the local anesthetic wears off. You will be prescribed a narcotic pain medication for pain management. Please take this as directed, and do not exceed the recommended dosing. Try to wean down as tolerated. These medications can cause constipation and you may want to use an over the counter stool softener. Tylenol products may be used instead of the prescribed pain medication, but should not be used with the narcotic pain medication as they both contain acetaminophen, and overdose can occur. You may supplement your pain medication by using ibuprofen or Aleve for any breakthrough pain. It can help to stagger your pain medication with ibuprofen or Aleve as needed. If a refill of pain medication is needed, please call the office during regular business hours, Monday-Friday 8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. In general, refills will not be made after hours or on weekends, so please plan ahead. Ice may be applied to the surgical area to help with pain. Avoid direct contact with the skin, as this may result in damage to the skin. Instead, wrap an ice pack or bag of ice in a towel before placing on the hand. We generally recommend icing 20 minutes on and 20 minutes off for the first 48 hours. Driving: To drive you must no longer be taking narcotic pain pills (plain Tylenol, ibuprofen, or Aleve is allowed). Also, you must feel strong and alert, and able to grip the steering wheel with both hands. Exercises/Activity: It is important to begin finger exercises after surgery to avoid finger stiffness. Exercises should be started the day of surgery and be done throughout the day, and are especially important during the first 4 weeks after surgery. Do the exercises 3-4 times a day, for 5-10 repetitions each, for 3-4 weeks after surgery. Exercises include opening and closing the hand, tendon gliding exercises (see below), and finger exercises (isolate the tip of the affected finger and bend and straighten the tip). Heavy lifting or strenuous activity should be avoided until permitted by your doctor, usually 3 weeks postoperatively. Hand therapy may be recommended for you following surgery. Follow-up: You should be seen in the office 10-14 days after surgery. Call the office if an appointment has not been made. Adverse Signs or Symptoms: Occasionally patients experience troubles after surgery and need additional medical attention. Such conditions that require medical attention include the following: \uf095 Fever of greater than 101 degrees F \uf020 \uf095 New or different colored drainage from your surgical incision or spreading redness or increased pain.\uf020 \u2022 Chest pain or shortness of breath. Seek medical attention immediately if you develop sudden chest pain, shortness of breath, a rapid heartbeat, lightheadedness or dizziness. \uf028 Questions/Concerns: \uf028If you have any additional questions or concerns, please feel free to call our office",

However, you must keep the incision dry until the sutures are removed at your follow-up doctor\u2019s appointment. We recommend keeping the incision site covered until your appointment. You can use the ace wrap provided to cover. \uf0b7 Do not use ointments of any kinds. It is common to have post-operative pain. You may wrap a bag of frozen peas or crushed ice in a thin towel and place on your incision Dr. Colten Luedke, Orthopaedic Surgery -(979) 776-0169 www.BCSortho.com www.DRCLuedke.com BCSortho.com DRCL for 15 minutes of every hour while you are awake. Elevating your hand above heart level on several pillows will also help with post- operative pain. You should take the prescribed medication only as needed and as prescribed.

Scar Management and Desensitization During your surgical procedure for carpal tunnel syndrome, your surgeon will release the transverse carpal ligament in your hand, Dr. Colten Luedke, Orthopaedic Surgery -(979) 776-0169 www.BCSortho.com www.DRCLuedke.com BCSortho.com DRCL leaving a gap where the ligament was cut. The gap eventually will fill with scar tissue. Two days after your sutures are removed, if the skin is completely closed, you will need to start massaging the scar. You will place your finger on the scar, and maintaining pressure move your finger in circles, diagonals, up and down, and side to side. Do this all along the length of the scar. Do not rub the skin, move the skin. Over time, the scar tissue matures and becomes less pliable. As it tightens, scar tissue can: \uf0b7 Interfere with achieving full range of motion \uf0b7 Cause pain \uf0b7 Cause hypersensitivity on or around the scar surface Often, the surgical site/scar and surrounding tissue are left feeling hypersensitive because the scar tissue and swelling have interrupted your skin\u2019s sensory nerve fibers. Performing scar massage and desensitization techniques can help your sensory nerves to normalize and function properly again. Frequently Asked Questions Can I use my hand after surgery? Starting immediately, you can move your hand for gentle range of motion. No lifting heavier than a telephone or coffee mug for 2 weeks. Can I drive after surgery? You may not drive yourself home from surgery. You must have a driver. Dr. Colten Luedke, Orthopaedic Surgery -(979) 776-0169 www.BCSortho.com www.DRCLuedke.com BCSortho.com DRCL You may not drive when you are taking narcotic pain medication. Your surgeon will tell you how long after your surgery until you can drive again. The legal position is that it\u2019s the patient who makes the decision as to whether you are safe to drive. How long will I be off work after surgery? When you can return to work depends on your occupation and progress, as assessed by your surgeon. Generally, you can return to work in 1 to 2 weeks. Call Immediately If You Experience Severe pain or swelling o Nail discoloration from pink to white or blue o Excessive bleeding or drainage o Increased redness o Fever of 101\u00b0F or greater o If any of these signs appear, consult your physician immediately Dr. Colten Luedke, Orthopaedic Surgery -(979) 776-0169 www.BCSortho.com www.DRCLuedke.com BCSortho.com DRCL Dr. Colten Luedke, Orthopaedic Surgery -(979) 776-0169 w",

Hess, MD Tracey Pederson, PCC Office: (763) 3012-2223 Fax: (763) 302-2401 WOUND CARE: \u2022 After surgery, wounds are typically covered with a soft dressing. This should be left in place until your follow-up appointment. Make sure to keep the dressing clean and dry. \u2022 Do not stick anything into the ends of the dressing. This can introduce bacteria or cause scratches which may develop into infection. DIET: \u2022 After surgery, some patients experience nausea. This can be related to anesthesia or pain medication. It is best to begin with clear liquids and light food (crackers). You may progress slowly to your normal diet if not nauseated. \u2022 Patients are often prescribed an anti-nausea medication after surgery. This can be used to treat nausea. If nausea or vomiting persists despite medication, call the office. \u2022 Pain medication can also cause constipation. An over-the-counter laxative, high-fiber diet or fruit juice may be helpful. MEDICATION: \u2022 Most home medications may be resumed the evening of surgery or the following day unless specifically directed by your surgeon. \u2022 Typically, patients are given a prescription for pain medication. Please take this medication as instructed. \u2022 Try to take pain medication with food to help decrease nausea. \u2022 Some prescribed pain medication may already have Tylenol (Acetaminophen) mixed with it. Do not take any other medications that include Tylenol while taking these pain medications. Taking too much Tylenol can cause liver damage. \u2022 Taking medication prior to bedtime may help with sleeping. \u2022 Do not drink alcohol or drive while taking narcotic pain medication (hydrocodone, oxycodone, dilaudid, etc.). \u2022 Pain medication typically takes about 30-45 minutes to take effect. Don\u2019t wait until pain is severe to take pain medication. \u2022 Some patients may receive a nerve block prior to surgery. This block lasts a different length of time in each patient, but typically lasts 12-18 hours. When you begin to feel some tingling in the extremity, the block is beginning to wear off. This is a good time to begin taking oral pain medication. \u2022 Pain medication likely will not take away all of your pain. It is okay to have some discomfort. \u2022 Because of the risks of prolonged narcotic use, in most cases narcotic pain medication will not be prescribed after 6 weeks after surgery. Plan to wean narcotic use after surgery accordingly. ACTIVITY: \u2022 You may use your hand, but do not perform any tight grip activities for the first few weeks after surgery. \u2022 You are encouraged to open and close your hand to encourage circulation and prevent stiffness. \u2022 Return to work depends on your job requirements, specifics of your surgery and pain/swelling levels. This can be discussed at your follow-up appointment. \u2022 Do not resume sports, use exercise equipment or perform strenuous physical activity (including lifting weights) until your surgeon says it is okay. \u2022 Return to driving after surgery is okay once narcotic pain medication has been stopped and you are cleared by your surgeon. The length of time until patients are able to return to driving varies depending on the specific surgery performed. This can be discussed with your surgeon during a clinic visit after surgery.

      "text_content": "Post-operative Instructions: Trigger Finger Release DIET \uf0b7 Begin with clear liquids and light foods (Jell-O, soups, etc.) \uf0b7 Progress to your normal diet if you are not nauseated MEDICATIONS Prescribed Narcotics: \uf0b7 This medication may be taken as needed for pain as directed on the bottle. \uf0b7 Do not drive or drink alcohol while taking this medication. Acetaminophen (Tylenol)/OTC Anti-inflammatory medication (Ibuprofen or Aleve) \uf0b7 This medications may be taken as needed. \uf0b7 Please use as directed on the bottle. \uf0b7 Do not exceed 4,000 mg of Acetaminophen in a 24 hour period. Stool softener: \uf0b7 We recommend picking up an over the counter stool softer as a common side effect of narcotic pain medication is constipation. \uf0b7 It is normal to take several days to make a bowel movement after surgery. \uf0b7 Drink plenty of clear liquids as the anesthesia can cause dehydration/constipation as well. WOUND CARE \uf0b7 After surgery, a bulky dressing will be placed on your hand and wrist. Your dressing should be kept clean and dry. The dressing can be removed 1-2 days after surgery, and the hand lightly cleaned with soap and water. The incision should not be soaked in water, such as in a bathtub, or vigorously rubbed to clean. You may dry the incision by patting it lightly with a clean, dry towel. A new, clean dressing should then be applied over the incision, such as a band aid. Dressings should be changed daily and as needed for any bleeding or drainage. \uf0b7 The incision should be inspected daily, and any abnormal drainage or excessive bleeding should be reported immediately. \uf0b7 Your sutures (if necessary) will be removed at your clinic visit, usually 10-14 days after surgery. There may be a superficial crack or separation at the incision line, which is normal. The outer layers of the callused palmar skin do not grow back together well, but the deeper tissues will. The separation on the skin will grow out with time and be flat. ACTIVITY \uf0b7 To drive you must no longer be taking narcotic pain pills (plain Tylenol, ibuprofen, or Aleve is allowed). Also, you must feel strong and alert, and able to grip the steering wheel with both hands. \uf0b7 Elevate your hand to decrease swelling and discomfort. Mild to moderate swelling is expected after surgery. Your hand should be elevated above the level of your heart for best results. Local anesthesia has been used around the incision, which may cause numbness of the fingers and may last for hours up to a full day. Discomfort may return as the local anesthetic wears off. UPDATED: 02/05/2023 \uf0b7 Ice may be applied to the surgical area to help with pain. Avoid direct contact with the skin, as this may result in damage to the skin. Instead, wrap an ice pack or bag of ice in a towel before placing on the hand. We generally recommend icing 20 minutes on and 20 minutes off for the first 48 hours. EXERCISE \uf0b7 It is important to begin finger exercises after surgery to avoid finger stiffness. Exercises should be started the day of surgery and be done throughout the day, and are especially important during the first 4 weeks after surgery. Do the exercises 3-4 times a day, for 5-10 repetitions each, for 3-4 weeks after surgery. Exercises include opening and closing the hand, tendon gliding exercises (see below), and finger exercises (isolate the tip of the affected finger and bend and straighten the tip). Heavy lifting or strenuous activity should be avoided until permitted by your doctor, usually 3 weeks postoperatively. Hand therapy may be recommended for you following surgery. EMERGENCIES Contact our office at (608) 231-3410, if any of the following are present: \uf0b7 Painful swelling or numbness (note that some swelling and numbness is normal) \uf0b7 Unrelenting pain \uf0b7 Fever (over 101\u00b0 \u2013 it is normal to have a low grade fever for the first day or two following surgery) or chills \uf0b7 Color change in distal arm and/or hand \uf0b7 Continuous drainage or bleeding from incision (a small amount of drainage is expected) \uf0b7 Difficulty breathing \uf0b7 Excessive nausea/vomiting \uf0b7 Calf pain \uf0b7 If you have an emergency that requires immediate attention proceed to the nearest emergency room. UPDATED: 02/05/2023 FOLLOW-UP CARE/QUESTIONS \uf0b7 If you do not already have a post-operative appointment scheduled or if you need to change the appointment, please contact our scheduler at 608-231-3410 to schedule. \uf0b7 Your first post-operative appointment will be scheduled with one of the Physician Assistants, for a wound check, physical therapy protocol and to answer any further questions you have regarding the procedure \uf0b7 Typically the first post-operative appointment is made for 10-14 days following surgery for suture removal if you have any sutures in place.

Originally from Winnetka, Illinois, I attended Northwestern University graduating in 1987, cum laude, president of Mortar Board Senior Honor Society and a member of Phi Betta Kappa. I continued my studies at Northwestern University School of Medicine, receiving my medical degree in 1991 as a member of Alpha Omega Alpha honor society. Following my graduation, I pursued advanced orthopedic training at Cornell Hospital for Special Surgery, which is ranked as the top orthopedic hospital in the United States. In addition, I completed a specialized training fellowship program in elbow and hand surgery at the Mayo Clinic. My practice is focused on shoulder, elbow, hand, microvascular, traumatic, and reconstructive surgery. It is my mission to provide you compassionate care with expertise comparable to any major university center. I am humbled by my inclusion in two prestigious quality health care listings: as a Castle Connolly Regional Top Doctor, and the Best Doctors list. Earning a place on either list is a result of being nominated by other physicians and a thorough review by the listing organization into my background, professional achievements, patient satisfaction and positive treatment record. Inclusion on the Best DoctorR list is a direct result of other doctors selecting me as the person they would choose to treat themselves or a family member. These are honors I take very seriously and I am committed to maintaining the high standards they represent with all my patients. I am actively involved in continuing education, have given numerous lectures, and published many orthopedic articles. As Clinical Associate Professor of Surgery at the University of Illinois College of Medicine, I have been awarded the Golden Apple teaching award and the Excellence in Teaching award. I am a reviewer for the acclaimed Journal of Shoulder and Elbow Surgery and currently serve as a faculty member at the Orthopedic Learning Center, where I teach other surgeons the latest techniques of hand, elbow and shoulder surgery.

      "text_content": "Rehabilitation Protocol for Achilles Rupture Repair This protocol is intended to guide clinicians through the post-operative course for Achilles tendon repair. This protocol is time based (dependent on tissue healing) as well as criterion based. Specific intervention should be based on the needs of the individual and should consider exam findings and clinical decision making. The timeframes for expected outcomes contained within this guideline may vary based on surgeon\u2019s preference, additional procedures performed, and/or complications. If a clinician requires assistance in the progression of a post-operative patient, they should consult with the referring surgeon. The interventions included within this protocol are not intended to be an inclusive list. Therapeutic interventions should be included and modified based on the progress of the patient and under the discretion of the clinician. Considerations for the Post-operative Achilles tendon repair program Many different factors influence the post-operative Achilles tendon rehabilitation outcomes, including type and location of the Achilles tear and repair. Consider taking a more conservative approach to range of motion, weight bearing, and rehab progression with tendon augmentation, re-rupture after non-surgical management, revision, chronic tendinosis, and co-morbidities, for example, obesity, older age, and steroid use. It is recommended that clinicians collaborate closely with the referring physician regarding intra-operative findings and satisfaction with the strength of the repair. If the patient develops a fever, unresolving numbness/tingling, excessive drainage from the incision, uncontrolled pain or any other symptoms you have concerns about, the referring physician should be contacted. PHASE I: IMMEDIATE POST-OP (0-3 WEEKS AFTER SURGERY) Rehabilitation \u2022 Protect repair Goals \u2022 Maintain strength of hip, knee and core \u2022 Manage swelling Weight Bearing Walking \u2022 Non-weight bearing (NWB) on crutches in splint and/or Achilles boot Intervention Range of motion/Mobility (in boot/splint) \u2022 Supine passive hamstring stretch Strengthening (in boot/splint) \u2022 Quad sets \u2022 Straight leg raise \u2022 Abdominal bracing \u2022 Hip abduction \u2022 Clamshell \u2022 Prone hip extension \u2022 Prone hamstring curls Criteria to \u2022 Pain < 5/10 Progress PHASE II: INTERMEDIATE POST-OP (4-6 WEEKS AFTER SURGERY) Rehabilitation \u2022 Continue to protect repair Goals \u2022 Avoid over-elongation of the Achilles Massachusetts General Brigham Sports Medicine \u2022 Reduce pain, minimize swelling \u2022 Improve scar mobility once incision is healed \u2022 Restore ankle plantar flexion, inversion, and eversion \u2022 Dorsiflexion to neutral \u2022 Normalize gait as much as possible while in boot by utilizing a Shoe Leveler for the uninvolved side to prevent secondary musculoskeletal complaints. Weight Bearing Walking (**Weight-bearing, wedge use/weaning, and boot types may vary by surgeon/practice.) \u2022 Week 4: Begin partial progressive weight-bearing on crutches in an Achilles boot with 3 wedges (~1\u201d in height each). Suggest gradually progress weight-bearing by 25% of body weight per week as tolerated until Full Weight-bearing (FWB) through the surgical side without pain. \u2022 Week 5: Wean one heel wedge leaving 2 wedges remaining in Achilles Boot. \u2022 Week 6: Wean 2nd heel wedge, leaving 1 wedge remaining in Achilles Boot. Additional Range of motion/Mobility Interventions \u2022 Initiate ankle passive range of motion (PROM), active assisted range of motion (AAROM) and *Continue with active range of motion (AROM) - DO NOT dorsiflex (DF) ankle past 0 degrees Phase I o Ankle pumps (do not DF ankle beyond neutral/0 degrees) interventions o Ankle circles (do not DF ankle beyond neutral/0 degrees) o Ankle inversion o Ankle eversion o Seated heel-slides in chair for ankle DF ROM (not past 0 degrees) \u2022 If stiff from immobilization, initiate great toe DF and PF stretching (by patient or therapist) \u2013 Do not exceed neutral (0 degrees) DF at ankle when performing this stretch. \u2022 Foot and ankle joint mobilizations: per therapist discretion o Modify hand placement to avoid pressure on healing incision \u2022 May begin gentle scar mobilization once incision is healed - NO instrument assisted soft tissue mobilization (IASTM) directly on tendon until at least 16 weeks post-op.

This splint starts at the toes, goes along the undersurface of the foot, behind the ankle, and up the calf to stop just below the knee. DO NOT bear weight while wearing the splint. o Once the swelling goes down (typically about 2 weeks), you will transition to a CAM walker, this the boot-like brace. You will also have heel lifts in the bottom of the CAM walker. You will be instructed on how to remove the lifts, and how to progress weight bearing at the first post-op appointment. You will wear the CAM walker for the first 6 weeks. You will also use crutches for the first 4-6 weeks. \uf0a7 Must keep splint and brace dry. Must be seated to shower. - Weight bearing precautions o Immediately after surgery you will have crutches with the post-op splint. ***You may not put any weight on the surgical leg until the first post-op visit, day 10-14. o At the first post-op visit, you\u2019ll be informed how much weight you can put on the leg. - Physical Therapy o You will start formal PT after your first post-op visit. You will go 2x/week for about 6 months. \uf0a7 Dedication and attendance to your sessions are critical to your recovery. \uf0a7 For recommendations on where to go for PT, please contact the office. INSTRUCTIONS FOR IMMEDIATELY AFTER SURGERY: - Activity o Apply ice to your ankle but keep the bandages dry o Elevate your leg on 2-3 pillows to reduce swelling, even when sleeping o Follow the weight bearing precaution guidelines above. - Bandage and Incision Care o Keep the post-op splint on until your first post-op appointment. o Must stay dry o Incision care/ removal will be provided at the first post-op appointment o Do not apply creams, ointments, or lotions to your incisions. - Showering o You may shower anytime, but you need to be seated and keep everything dry. o Highly recommend getting a shower chair/ stool or take a bath with the operative leg held out of the tub o Wrap the post-op splint in a garbage bag and seal with saran wrap at the time. Alternatively, you can purchase a cast cover. - Driving o You may not drive while taking pain medication. In addition, if it is your right lower extremity that had surgery, you will not be able to drive for approximately 6 weeks after surgery or until the boot is removed. - Normal sensations after surgery o Pain o Swelling and warmth up to 2 weeks o Small amounts of bloody drainage for first few days o Numbness around the incision area o Bruising o Low grade temperature less than 101.0 for up to 2 days after surgery. o Small amount of redness to the area where the sutures insert in the skin - IF ANY OF THE FOLLOWING OCCUR, CONTACT THE OFFICE IMMEDIATELY o Worsening or new calf pain or swelling in either leg o Change is noted to your incision (i.e. increased redness or drainage) o Temperature greater than 101.0 o Fever, chills, nausea, vomiting or diarrhea o Sutures become loose or fall out and incision becomes open o Drainage becomes yellow, puss like or foul smelling o Increased pain unrelieved by medication or measures mentioned above. - Post-op visit o Please ensure that you have a post-op visit scheduled for 10-14 days after surgery. PAIN MANAGEMENT ORAL PAIN MEDICATIONS o Naproxen 500 mg \uf0a7 Take 1 tablet twice per day to help with pain and inflammation. You will take this for 2 weeks. o Tylenol 500 mg \uf0a7 Start by taking one tablet every four to six hours when you arrive home after surgery so you have some medication on board when the block wears off.

RAMAPPA\u2019S POST-OPERATIVE INSTRUCTIONS Achilles Tendon Repair Sports Medicine Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center 617-667-3940 Wound Care: (cid:190) After your Achilles Tendon surgery, you will be placed in a splint. (cid:190) Be sure to keep the splint clean and dry. (cid:190) Your sutures will be removed during your office visit at 3-weeks following surgery. (cid:190) You may shower once the splint is removed. However, do not submerge you operative leg in water, such as a swimming pool or bathtub. Braces: (cid:190) You will remain in the splint until your first postoperative visit, about 2 weeks following your Achilles Tendon surgery. (cid:190) At the time of your 2-week visit, you will be placed into a boot in plantar flexion (with your toes pointing down). (cid:190) At this time, you may begin gentle active dorsiflexion (point toes up, then release \u2013 see pictures below). You should do this 3 times per day for 5 minutes at a time. This will be demonstrated at your first post operative visit. Crutches & Weight bearing status: (cid:190) Following an Achilles Tendon Repair, you will be non-weight bearing and using crutches, until otherwise directed. (cid:190) Non-weight bearing means that you keep your foot off the floor and support your weight using the crutches. (cid:190) Approximately 3 weeks following surgery, you will progress to touch down weight bearing. This means you able to partially bear weight (touch the floor lightly with your toes for balance) with crutches. (cid:190) However, do not put any weight onto your operative side until directed by Dr. Ramappa. Physical Therapy: (cid:190) Formal physical therapy will be ordered by your orthopedic surgeon in the form of a written prescription at approximately 10 \u2013 12 weeks following your surgery. (cid:190) In the meantime, you will be given a physical therapy protocol form (instructions from Dr. Ramappa). DR. RAMAPPA\u2019S POST-OPERATIVE INSTRUCTIONS Achilles Tendon Repair Sports Medicine Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center 617-667-3940 Dorsiflexion: Pull toes up and release. Do not push toes down. Pain Control: Narcotics (cid:190) You have been prescribed ___________________________, which is a narcotic pain medication. (cid:190) Use the medication only as prescribed. Take it with food. (cid:190) Do not drive or use any type of heavy machinery, drink alcohol, make any life-changing or legal decisions (i.e. sign a will), or participate in activities that require a lot of physical skill. (cid:190) Take a stool softener, such as Colace, while taking the narcotic medication, because narcotics may cause constipation. Non- Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Medications: (cid:190) Please take an over the counter non-steroidal anti-inflammatory such as Motrin, Advil, Ibuprofen (600 mg every 12 hours) or Aleve (500 mg every 12 hours) for additional pain control, only if you do not have a contraindication to taking this medication (i.e. allergy to the medication, stomach ulcers or kidney problems). (cid:190) Take this medication with food, and try to stagger the times you take this medication with your pain medication. This may help decrease the chance of stomach upset. (cid:190) If you can take Aspirin without any difficulty, then you should take Aspirin 325 mg daily for 4 weeks, starting the day of your surgery, upon arriving home. Driving: (cid:190) You may resume driving only when it is approved by your physician. (cid:190) Do not drive if you are still taking narcotic pain medications and/or you are still partial weight bearing. DR.

      "text_content": "Post-Op Instructions for Achilles Tendon Repair Jacob B. Stirton, MD DIET \u2022 Begin with clear liquids and light foods (jello, soups, etc). \u2022 Progress to your normal diet if you are not nauseated. WOUND CARE \u2022 Maintain your operative splint \u2013 clean, dry, and intact. \u2022 It is normal for the ankle to bleed and swell following surgery. If blood soaks onto the ACE bandage, do not become alarmed, reinforce with additional dressing. \u2022 To avoid infection, NO immersion of the operative leg (i.e.: bath or pool) until six weeks after surgery. \u2022 Please do not place any ointments lotions or creams on the incisions. MEDICATIONS \u2022 A nerve block is typically administered by the anesthesia team unless the patient specifically requests otherwise. This will wear off within 24-36 hours. Patients commonly encounter more pain on the first or second day after surgery when swelling peaks. \u2022 Some patients will require narcotic pain medication for a short period of time \u2013 I prescribe oxycodone which can be taken 1-2 tabs every 3 hours as needed for pain. \u2022 To minimize the need for narcotics, I prescribe ibuprofen and Tylenol to be taken three times per day each for the first 2 weeks. \u2022 Common side effects of the pain medication are nausea, drowsiness, and constipation. To decrease the side effects, take the medication with food. We prescribe a stool softener to help prevent constipation but be sure to drink plenty of water as well. If you are having problems with nausea and vomiting, we prescribe an antiemetic, Zofran. If this fails to resolve the issue please contact the office. \u2022 Do not drive a car or operate machinery while taking the narcotic medication. \u2022 Please avoid alcohol use while taking narcotic pain medication. \u2022 For 4 weeks following surgery take one aspirin 325mg tablet daily to lower the risk of developing a blood clot after surgery. Please contact the office should severe calf pain occur or significant swelling of the calf or ankle occur. ACTIVITY \u2022 You are non-weight bearing in your splint immediately after surgery. Use crutches for first 6 weeks after surgery. \u2022 Elevate the operative leg to chest level whenever possible to decrease swelling. \u2022 Do not place pillows under knees (i.e. do not maintain knee in a flexed or bent position), but rather place pillows under the foot/ankle. \u2022 Do not engage in activities which increase ankle pain/swelling (prolonged periods of standing or walking) for the first 7-10 days following surgery. \u2022 Avoid long periods of sitting (without leg elevated) or long distance traveling for 4 weeks. \u2022 NO driving until instructed otherwise by physician. \u2022 May return to sedentary work ONLY or school 3-4 days after surgery, if pain is tolerable. SPLINT/CAST \u2022 Keep clean, dry, and intact. ICE THERAPY \u2022 Icing is very important in the initial post-operative period and should begin immediately after surgery. \u2022 Use icing machine continuously or ice packs (if machine not prescribed) for 20-30 minutes every 2 hours daily until your first post-operative visit \u2013 remember to keep leg elevated to level of chest while icing. Avoid frostbite to the skin by not using icepacks for more than 30 minutes at a time. \u2022 You do not need to wake up in the middle of the night to change over the ice machine or icepacks unless you are uncomfortable. EXERCISE \u2022 Begin exercises 24 hours after surgery (straight leg raises, quad sets) unless otherwise instructed. \u2022 Formal physical therapy (PT) typically begins two weeks after surgery. A prescription and protocol will be provided at the first post op visit by Dr. Stirton. EMERGENCIES *Contact Dr. Stirton\u2019s office at 706-439-6858 if any of the following are present: \u2022 Fever (over 101\u00b0 F \u2013 it is normal to have a low-grade fever (<100\u00b0) for the first day or two following surgery) or chills \u2022 Redness around incisions \u2022 Color change in foot or ankle \u2022 Continuous drainage or bleeding from incision (a small amount of drainage is expected) *If you have any of the following emergencies that require immediate attention proceed to the nearest emergency room. \u2022 Excessive nausea/vomiting \u2022 Unrelenting pain or calf pain \u2022 Difficulty breathing FOLLOW-UP CARE/QUESTIONS \u2022 If you do not already have a post-operative appointment scheduled, please contact our scheduler at 706-439-6858 to schedule. \u2022 If you have any further questions please contact Dr. Stirton\u2019s office.",

      "text_content": "General Post-operative Instructions Achilles Tendon Repair Ryan W. Hess, MD Tracey Pederson, PCC Office: (763) 302-2223 Fax: (763) 302-2401 WOUND CARE: \u2022 After surgery, your leg will typically be placed in a splint. This should be left in place until your follow-up appointment. Keep the splint clean and dry. Do not stick anything into the top or bottom of the splint. \u2022 Skin stitches or staples will be removed at your first post-op appointment (usually about 2 weeks after surgery) \u2022 Patients are typically placed in a removable boot with heel wedges after the first 2 weeks. \u2022 You may take a shower or bath after surgery. The splint or cast needs to be kept clean and dry. Patients sometimes need a shower chair to help. Often, a bag is placed over the splint or cast to keep it dry. \u2022 Once you have been placed in a removable boot, you can remove it to take a shower or bath. Do not submerge the wound in water (bath, pool, lake) until it has completely healed. ICING/ELEVATION: \u2022 Icing is an important part of recovery from surgery. It is used to decrease swelling and inflammation. Apply ice for 20 minutes every hour. \u2022 You may apply ice over the top of the splint. Be sure not to let the splint get wet. \u2022 Keeping your leg elevated above your heart will also help decrease swelling. This is one of the most important parts of recovery and pain control. Remember, \u201cToes above your nose.\u201d DIET: \u2022 After surgery, some patients experience nausea. This can be related to anesthesia or pain medication. It is best to begin with clear liquids and light food (crackers). You may progress slowly to your normal diet if not nauseated. \u2022 Patients are sometimes prescribed an anti-nausea medication after surgery. This can be used to treat nausea. If nausea or vomiting persists despite medication, call the office. \u2022 Pain medication can also cause constipation. An over-the-counter laxative, high-fiber diet or fruit juice may be helpful. MEDICATION: \u2022 Most home medications may be resumed the evening of surgery or the following day unless specifically directed by your surgeon. \u2022 Typically, patients are given a prescription for pain medication. Take this medication as instructed. \u2022 Try to take pain medication with food to help decrease nausea. \u2022 Some prescribed pain medication may already have Tylenol (Acetaminophen) mixed with it. Do not take any other medications that include Tylenol while taking these pain medications. Taking too much Tylenol can cause liver damage. \u2022 Taking pain medication prior to bedtime may help with sleeping. \u2022 Do not drink alcohol or drive while taking narcotic pain medication (hydrocodone, oxycodone, dilaudid, etc.). \u2022 Pain medication typically takes about 30-45 minutes to take effect. Don\u2019t wait until pain is severe to take pain medication. \u2022 Some patients may receive a nerve block prior to surgery. This block lasts a different length of time in each patient, but typically lasts 12-18 hours. When you begin to feel some tingling in the extremity, the block is beginning to wear off. This is a good time to begin taking oral pain medication. \u2022 Pain medication will likely not take away all of your pain. It is okay to have some discomfort. \u2022 Because of the risks of prolonged narcotic use, in most cases narcotic pain medication will not be prescribed after 6 weeks from surgery. Plan to wean narcotic use after surgery accordingly. ACTIVITY: \u2022 Crutches, a walker, a knee scooter or a wheelchair will need to be used initially after surgery. \u2022 You will not be allowed to put any weight on the affected limb for approximately 2 weeks. This will vary from patient to patient and will be addressed at follow-up appointments. This is very important and allows healing of the repair. \u2022 Return to work depends on your job requirements, specifics of your surgery and pain/swelling levels. This can be discussed at your follow-up appointment. \u2022 Physical therapy will be prescribed after surgery. This is an important part of your recovery and we encourage patients to attend all physical therapy appointments. \u2022 Return to driving after surgery is okay once narcotic pain medication has been stopped and you are cleared by your surgeon. The length of time until patients are able to return to driving varies depending on the specific surgery and which leg is involved. BLOOD CLOT PREVENTION: \u2022 Though uncommon, blood clots (also called deep vein thrombosis or DVT) can occur after surgery. To decrease the risk of this problem, you should flex your ankle and toes up and down ten times per hour for the first 2-3 weeks after surgery. \u2022 Elevation of the operative leg also helps decrease swelling and prevent blood clots. \u2022 Some patients may be instructed to take aspirin daily for a period of time after surgery. \u2022 Be sure to let your surgeon know if you have a history of blood clots.

      "text_content": "Ronak M. Patel, MD Achilles Tendon Repair Surgery Post-Operative Instructions Please bring all post-operative DME to the surgical facility the day of surgery (this includes all crutches, braces, slings, polar care machines, etc.) Diet \uf0b7\uf020 You may resume your regular diet. However, start slow with clear liquids and gradually work your way back to your normal diet. This will help prevent nausea and vomiting. Wound Care \uf0b7\uf020 Keep the splint/cast on until your visit with Dr. Patel. It must remain absolutely 100% dry so do not get it wet. You can shower, but must keep the cast/splint dry by using a garbage bag or a sponge bath. \uf0b7\uf020 Do not put any lotions or antibiotic ointments over the incisions until they are completely closed. \uf0b7\uf020 Do not submerge your surgical leg or soak in a hot tub, swimming pool, or bath until your incisions have completely healed in approximately 4 weeks. \uf0b7\uf020 Sutures/Staples will be removed at your first post-op visit. DVT Prevention \uf0b7\uf020 You must wear your white TED hose compressive stocking on your non-operative leg until cleared by Dr. Patel. This stocking helps prevent blood clots. \uf0b7\uf020 Please perform ankle pumps as this will help prevent blood clots. \uf0b7\uf020 Sometimes we have to prescribe a blood thinner to help prevent blood clots. Given your medical history, surgery and activity level: o You are recommended to take one 325mg Aspirin daily by mouth for 2-4 weeks after surgery. Do not take Aspirin at the same time as NSAID medications. \uf0a7\uf020STOP THE ASPIRIN: If you have any stomach irritation, bleeding in your stool or you start vomiting blood. Contact Dr. Patel\u2019s office. o You do not need to take any additional medications o Other:____________________________________________________________ \uf0b7\uf020 If you are traveling after surgery, please let us know \u2013 we advise you to wait at least 1 week between travel and surgery. General tips for preventing blood clots when traveling after surgery: 1. Get up on the plane to crutch/walk every hour or if driving stop every 1-2 hours to get up and walk 2. Stay hydrated. Avoid alcohol and caffeine. 3. Wear your leg stockings 4. Take 325mg of Aspirin (unless allergic or have stomach or kidney problems) the day before travel, the day of travel and the day after travel 5. Do your exercises during travel especially ankle pumps 6. If you experience swelling in your calf or pain please call our office immediately or go to your local ED for evaluation Post-operative Activity and Weight Bearing \uf0b7\uf020 Given the extent of your surgery, your weight bearing restrictions are: o Non-weight bearing for 6 weeks minimum. Use your crutches during this time. Leg Elevation \uf0b7\uf020 Place pillows under the ankle/calf only. Do not bunch them directly under the knee. This will help reduce your swelling and allows for full extension of the leg, which is very important. Cold Therapy \uf0b7\uf020 Ice should be used to help reduce pain and swelling. Use it as often as possible the first 3 days after surgery, alternating 20 minutes on with 20 minutes off. After the third day, use it at least 3 to 5 times a day for 20 minutes each session until pain and swelling have resolved. Pain Medication \uf0b7\uf020 Take your pain medication as prescribed. This usually means 1 tablet every for 4 hours for mild pain or 2 tablets every 4-6 hours for severe pain. Do not take any additional Tylenol. \uf0b7\uf020 The pain medication may also cause constipation if you take it regularly, so take the prescribed stool softener as needed. Over the counter treatments include: stool softener, fiber bar, Metamucil or prune juice to prevent constipation. \uf0b7\uf020 No driving while taking any narcotic pain medication. \uf0b7\uf020 The pain medication may cause some nausea so take it with some food. Effective October 6, 2014, federal regulation prevents the ability to call or fax post-operative pain medications to pharmacies (including refills). Every prescription must be an original and presented in person; please keep this in mind when requesting additional medications. Nerve Blocks for Anesthesia If you had a nerve block this can last approximately 12-24 hours, sometimes longer. You may notice tingling on occasion after the block wears off. This usually resolves in several days, but if it persists please call the office. As you begin to regain your sensation take your pain medication before the block wears completely off. This will help you prevent getting behind on pain control. Notify the Office if you Experience the Following \uf0b7\uf020 Flu-like symptoms, nausea/vomiting, temperature of 101.5 degrees or higher, severe chills; foul odor, redness, or increased tenderness or drainage from the incision. These are signs of a possible infection. You may need to report to an Emergency Room. \uf0b7\uf020 Hot tender area or unusually large amounts of swelling in either calf or other area of the leg; chest pain, shortness of breath or coughing up blood. These are signs of a possible blood clot and you may need to report to an Emergency Room or call an ambulance. \uf0b7\uf020 For urgent problems that occur duri",

      "text_content": "Rehabilitation Protocol: Achilles Tendon Repair Protocol Department of Orthopaedic Surgery Lahey Hospital & Medical Center, Burlington 781-744-8650 Lahey Outpatient Center, Lexington 781-372-7020 Lahey Medical Center, Peabody 978-538-4267 Department of Rehabilitation Services Lahey Hospital & Medical Center, Burlington 781-744-8645 Lahey Hospital & Medical Center, South Bedford Street, Burlington 781-744-8648 Lahey Danvers Rehabilitation, Danvers 978-739-7400 Lahey Outpatient Center, Lexington 781-372-7060 \u25c4 Overview The Achilles tendon is a strong tendon attaching the two major calf muscles (gastrocnemius and soleus) to the heel bone (calcaneus). The calf muscle is a major muscle we use for running, jumping and climbing. As we lose some flexibility and strength over time, it becomes more difficult for the Achilles tendon to sustain significant forces produced by the calf muscle. This can lead to possible tendon rupture with forceful pushing off during activities such as basketball, tennis or racquetball. The surgical approach to repair the torn tendon requires post-operative protection to allow appropriate healing. There are certain milestones during rehabilitation that require that the patient be an active participant in rehabilitation to help ensure the best outcome. The goals of this surgery are to repair the torn Achilles tendon, maximize function of ADLs, maximize quality of life, and ultimately allow patients to return to prior level of activity. 2 Achilles Tendon Rupture Repair, Brittany Lento, DPT; Mark Dynan, PT, DPT 12_2019 \u25c4 Phase I Acute Post-Op Phase 0\u22122 Week, Home Goals \uf0b7 Allow soft tissue healing \uf0b7 Reduce pain, inflammation, and swelling \uf0b7 Increase independence with bed mobility, transfers, and gait \uf0b7 Educate patient regarding weight bearing Precautions \uf0b7 Patients are NWB and must use walker or crutches to maintain NWB status \uf0b7 Keep incision clean and dry \uf0b7 No showering until MD approves \uf0b7 Observe for signs of deep vein thrombosis (DVT): increased swelling, erythema, calf pain. If present, notify MD immediately For Patients: Week 1 and 2: \uf0b7 You will be placed in a plaster splint secured with ace bandages. \uf0b7 Leave the splint and dressings as placed until your 2 week follow-up appointment. \uf0b7 Take pain medication and antibiotic medication as directed. \uf0b7 Keep surgical leg elevated while lying down with \u201ctoes above nose\u201d for 45 minutes out of every hour (this is important to keep swelling down). \uf0b7 You can get up to use rest room, eat, wash, etc. Do not put any weight on your surgical leg. You must remain non-weight bearing (NWB) and use walker or crutches to get from room to room. \uf0b7 Do not let your knee and hip get stiff! Bend and straighten knee several times every hour. You can do this lying down or sitting. 3 Achilles Tendon Rupture Repair, Brittany Lento, DPT; Mark Dynan, PT, DPT 12_2019 \u25c4 Phase II \u2013 Protection Phase (Weeks 2-8, patient at home) Goals \uf0b7 Allow healing/follow precautions \uf0b7 Reduce pain, inflammation, and swelling \uf0b7 Increase independence with bed mobility, transfers, and gait \uf0b7 Gait training \u2013 Appropriate use of assistive device to emphasize NWB Precautions \uf0b7 Patient continues to be NWB with walker or crutches until 4-6 weeks post-op (most cases are 6 weeks, unless specifically instructed by your surgeon) \uf0b7 Patient can be weight bearing as tolerated (WBAT) in boot at 6 weeks post-op \uf0b7 Monitor wound healing for signs and symptoms of infection. If present, notify MD For Patients: Weeks 2-8: \uf0b7 At your 2 week follow-up appointment, you will be placed in a fiberglass cast that will stay on until 6 weeks post-op. \uf0b7 You need to continue to be NWB using walker or crutches. \uf0b7 You will be given orders for outpatient physical therapy that will start at 8 weeks post-op. \uf0b7 You will be given instructions to call outpatient physical therapy department to schedule your physical therapy consult for 8 weeks after your surgery. \uf0b7 At 6 week follow-up appointment, the fiberglass cast will be removed and you will be placed in a removable boot. \uf0b7 Heel lifts will be placed in the boot to make sure your foot is in the most appropriate position in the boot. \uf0b7 At 6 weeks post-op, you will now be able to put some weight on your foot when you walk, but not full weight. This is called weight bearing as tolerated (WBAT). You will be instructed how to walk this way at your 6 week follow-up appointment. \uf0b7 You will continue with WBAT in boot with lifts for the next two weeks until your outpatient PT consult at 8 weeks post-op. 4 Achilles Tendon Rupture Repair, Brittany Lento, DPT; Mark Dynan, PT, DPT 12_2019 \u25c4 Phase III \u2013 Transitional Phase (Weeks 8-12, guided by outpatient physical therapist) Goals \uf0b7 Reduce pain and inflammation \uf0b7 Increase range of motion (ROM) gradually \uf0b7 Increase strength \uf0b7 Balance and proprioceptive training to assist with functional activities \uf0b7 Gait training: Gradual removal of heel lifts and progress from WBAT to FWB \uf0b7 Functional activity training to enhance patient autonomy with ADLs/mobi",

It is normal to experience some sharp pain in the front of the knee when working on moving your knee. However, you will not move the knee before seeing us in the office for your first post-operative visit. \u25cf DIET \u25cb Begin with clear liquids and light foods (jellos, soups, etc.) \u25cb Progress to your normal diet if you are not nauseated \u25cf WOUND CARE \u25cb Maintain your operative dressing, loosen bandage if swelling of the foot and ankle occurs \u25cb It is normal for the knee to bleed and swell following surgery \u2013 if blood soaks through the ACE bandage, do not become alarmed \u2013 reinforce with additional dressing \u25cb Remove surgical dressing on the third post-operative day \u2013 if minimal drainage is present, apply dry gauze over incisions and change daily \u2013 you may then shave around the wound as long as the wounds remain sealed with the band-aid \u25a0 REMOVE THE ACE WRAP, GAUZE WRAP AND GAUZE. DO NOT REMOVE THE WHITE BANDAIDS (STERISTRIPS) ACROSS THE SKIN OR ANY SUTURE MATERIAL YOU NOTICE \u25cb If you note increasing drainage on the gauze, increased redness around the wound (spreading), or milky drainage from the wound, please call the office \u25cb To avoid infection, keep surgical incisions clean and dry \u2013 you may shower by placing a large garbage bag over your brace starting the day after surgery \u2013 NO immersion of operative leg (i.e.bath) \u25cb If you are not using a brace, keep the incisions dry for 3 days and when you shower on day 3, keep the incisions covered with gauze to avoid direct impact of water with the wound, and change this after the shower Adam B. Yanke, MD Office Phone: 312-432-2440 Email: Adam.Yanke@RushOrtho.com Website: wwwYankeMD.com \u25cf MEDICATIONS \u25cb The incisions are injected with a medication that makes the area numb; however, this will wear off in 8-12 hours. We recommend that you start pain medications when you get home so that they are on board before this wears off. \u25cb Most patients will require some narcotic pain medication for a short period of time \u2013 this can be taken as per directions on the bottle and is given for a maximum of 6 weeks. \u25cb Common side effects of the pain medication are nausea, drowsiness, and constipation \u2013 to decrease the side effects, take medication with food \u2013 if constipation occurs, consider taking an over-the-counter laxative \u25cb If you are having problems with nausea and vomiting, contact the office to possibly have your medication changed (312-432-2440) \u25cb Do not drive a car or operate machinery while taking the narcotic medication \u25cb Ibuprofen 200-400mg (i.e. Advil) may be taken in between the narcotic pain medication to provide baseline relief, reducing the overall amount of pain medication required, and increase the time intervals between narcotic pain medication usage \u25cb We recommend all patients take 325 mg of Aspirin daily starting the day after surgery for 3 weeks to help prevent blood clots. \u25cf ACTIVITY \u25cb Elevate the operative leg ABOVE chest level whenever possible to decrease swelling. This involves lying completely flat with the leg elevated. The first 48 hours is a balance between mobilization (which is encourage) and elevation (to be done whenever possible). \u25cb DO NOT PLACE A PILLOW UNDER THE BACK OF YOUR KNEE (i.e. do not maintain knee in a flexed or bent position). Pillows should be under the ankle which will keep the knee straight when elevating. You will feel a pull at the back of the knee when you perform this, this is normal. \u25cb Crutches are only for support the first 24-28 hours after surgery, feel free to walk without crutches as soon as you believe you can safely do so. \u25cb Do not engage in activities which increase knee pain/swelling (prolonged periods of standing or walking) over the first 7-10 days following surgery \u25cb Avoid long periods of sitting (without leg elevated) or long distance traveling for 2 weeks \u25cb NO driving until instructed otherwise by physician and no driving while taking narcotics \u25cb May return to sedentary work ONLY or school 3-4 days after surgery, if pain is tolerable Adam B.

      "text_content": "Post-Op Instructions for Hip Fracture Fixation Jacob B. Stirton, MD DIET \u2022 Begin with clear liquids and light foods (jello, soups, etc). \u2022 Progress to your normal diet if you are not nauseated. WOUND CARE \u2022 Maintain your operative dressings. \u2022 It is normal for the hip to bleed and swell following surgery. If blood soaks onto the bandage, do not become alarmed, reinforce with additional dressing. \u2022 Remove surgical dressing on the second day after surgery. Replace dressings with clean 4x4s and tape. \u2022 You can get the incisions wet in the shower (water and soap lightly run over the incisions and pat dry). Simply pad dry afterwards. \u2022 Note that because you cannot place weight on the operative leg that you require the use of a shower chair so that you may safely sit while showering. \u2022 To avoid infection, NO immersion of the operative leg (i.e.: bath or pool) until six weeks after surgery. \u2022 Please do not place any ointments lotions or creams on the incisions. \u2022 Sutures are typically removed between 10-14 days post operatively. MEDICATIONS \u2022 A nerve block is typically administered by the anesthesia team unless the patient specifically requests otherwise. This will wear off within 24-36 hours. Patients commonly encounter more pain on the first or second day after surgery when swelling peaks. \u2022 Some patients will require narcotic pain medication for a short period of time \u2013 I prescribe oxycodone which can be taken 1-2 tabs every 3 hours as needed for pain. \u2022 To minimize the need for narcotics, I prescribe ibuprofen and Tylenol to be taken three times per day each for the first 2 weeks. \u2022 Common side effects of the pain medication are nausea, drowsiness, and constipation. To decrease the side effects, take the medication with food. We prescribe a stool softener to help prevent constipation but be sure to drink plenty of water as well. If you are having problems with nausea and vomiting, we prescribe an antiemetic, Zofran. If this fails to resolve the issue please contact the office. \u2022 Do not drive a car or operate machinery while taking the narcotic medication. \u2022 Please avoid alcohol use while taking narcotic pain medication. \u2022 For 4 weeks following surgery take one aspirin 325mg tablet daily to lower the risk of developing a blood clot after surgery. Please contact the office should severe calf pain occur or significant swelling of the calf or ankle occur. ACTIVITY \u2022 You will either be weight bearing as tolerated or toe touch weight bearing, both with a walker as soon as comfortable immediately after surgery. This depends on the fracture and fixation type. \u2022 Don\u2019t bend your hip past a 90 degree angle. \u2022 Don\u2019t cross your legs. \u2022 Don\u2019t twist your hip inwards-keep knees and toes pointed upwards. \u2022 Do not engage in activities which increase hip pain/swelling (prolonged periods of standing or walking) for the first 7-10 days following surgery. \u2022 Avoid long periods of sitting (without leg elevated) or long distance traveling for 2 weeks. \u2022 NO driving until instructed otherwise by physician. \u2022 May return to sedentary work ONLY 5-7 days after surgery, if pain is tolerable. ICE THERAPY \u2022 Icing is very important in the initial post-operative period and should begin immediately after surgery. \u2022 Use ice packs for 20-30 minutes every 2 hours daily for 3 days post-operatively. Avoid frostbite to the skin by not using icepacks for more than 30 minutes at a time. \u2022 You do not need to wake up in the middle of the night to change the icepacks unless you are uncomfortable. EXERCISE \u2022 Begin exercises 24 hours after surgery (gait training, stairs, quad sets, straight leg raises, etc.) unless otherwise instructed. \u2022 Complete exercises 3-4 times daily until your first post-operative visit. \u2022 Perform ankle pumps continuously throughout the day to reduce the risk of developing a blood clot in your calf. \u2022 Formal physical therapy (PT) typically begins the day of surgery. A prescription and protocol will be provided at the time of surgery unless deferred by Dr. Stirton.

Bedford, M.D. 159 East 74th Street New York, NY 10021 Tel (212) 737-3301 Instruction Sheet following Achilles Tendon Repair Splint and Dressings: The post operative splint and dressings place on you immediately after your surgery must stay on at all times and should be kept clean, dry, and in place. You should cover it when bathing to keep it dry. Use CAUTION when showering so as not to slip and fall. Minimize use of the leg and NEVER bear weight on or lift with the leg that was operated on at any point before your first post-operative visit. Use crutches or a knee scooter/walker for comfort and ambulation. Ice and Elevation: Keep the leg elevated as much as possible above the level of the heart to minimize swelling and decrease discomfort. You can do this by using pillows and leg rests. It is normal to have some swelling of the toes and lower leg, even with adequate elevation. You may ice the toes/lower leg over your dressings as much as desired for 20 minutes at a time with 20 minutes of rest between icing. You may repeat this cycle as much as you\u2019d like. Know that icing still has a cooling effect even if you don\u2019t feel it through your dressings or splint. This will minimize swelling. Follow-up visit: You need to see the doctor 11-14 days following surgery for your first post-op visit. At that time, your post-operative splint and dressings will be taken off and your sutures (stitches) will be removed at that time. Call the office to arrange this appointment if it hasn\u2019t already been made. Common Concerns: 1. Bruising and/or swelling of toes, ankle, or lower leg will continue to develop and may change patterns as time goes on. This is caused by bleeding from the torn tendon into the area below the skin; gravity pulls the bruising downward into the toes. Do not be alarmed by this swelling and/or bruising anywhere along the lower leg. 2. Numbness or tingling of the lower leg is a result of disruption of superficial skin nerves during the procedure, or irritation to these nerves due to swelling. Most of this will resolve over time. 3. A sudden rush or feeling of fullness with pain when going from sitting to standing of the lower leg is common after surgery. Please call immediately if: 1. If at any time you have discomfort, hardness, swelling, or redness in the calf (behind the leg between the knee and the ankle) please call the doctor immediately. 2. Any oozing or redness of the wound, fevers (>101.3 degrees F), or chills. 3. Any difficulty breathing or heaviness in the chest. REMEMBER - these are only guidelines for what to expect following an achilles tendon repair. If you have any questions or concerns please do not hesitate to call the office.",

These orthopaedic injuries are often associated with significant health care costs, decreased productivity in the workplace, and, in some cases, long-term disability. The optimal management of trauma patients with orthopaedic injuries requires significant physician and institutional commitment. The American College of Surgeons (ACS) Resources for the Optimal Care of the Injured Patient, 2014 includes several key hospital and provider- level orthopaedic trauma criteria that must be met in order to attain American College of Surgeons trauma center verification. Although these criteria are important, they do not cover the entire breadth of orthopaedic trauma care. Furthermore, trauma centers may identify areas in need of improvement that are unique to their hospital. These best practice guidelines represent a compilation of the best evidence available for each respective topic. In areas where the literature is inconclusive, incomplete, or controversial, expert opinion is provided. As such, there are several points worth mentioning: z All facilities should have in place appropriate pain management guidelines for those suffering from traumatic orthopaedic injury. z All patients with orthopaedic injuries should be preferentially placed in hospital units staffed by nurses who receive ongoing orthopaedic-specific in-service training. z For high-risk injuries, facilities should have guidelines ensuring ongoing neurovascular assessments prior to fixation. z When appropriate, prosthetics counseling, evaluation, and implementation should be made available in a timely manner. In addition to an outline of best practices, we have also included appropriate performance improvement (PI) indicators (Appendix A) that you might use as a guide to continually evaluate the delivery of orthopaedic trauma care in your center. 3 z Direct communication between TRIAGE AND TRANSFER transferring and receiving institutions is important prior to patient OF ORTHOPAEDIC transfer and when breakdowns INJURIES in the transfer process occur. Key Messages The optimal care of patients with musculoskeletal injuries relies upon the z Optimal care of orthopaedic injuries orthopaedic provider and the institution occurs when both the health care at which he or she practices.

Ferrel, MD DIET \u2022 Begin with clear liquids and light foods (jello, soups, etc.) \u2022 Progress to your normal diet if you are not nauseated WOUND CARE \u2022 Maintain your operative dressing, loosen bandage if swelling of the foot and ankle occurs \u2022 It is normal bleeding and swelling following surgery. If blood soaks onto the ACE bandage, do not become alarmed, reinforce with additional dressing \u2022 Remove surgical dressing on the third post-operative day. \u2022 To avoid infection, keep surgical incisions clean and dry until your follow up appointment \u2013 you may shower by placing waterproof bandage (i.e. a large plastic bag) over boot beginning the day after surgery. NO immersion of the operative extremity (ie: bath or pool). \u2022 If present, please keep steri-strips in place. \u2022 Please do not place any ointments lotions or creams on the incisions. \u2022 If sutures are present, they will be removed around 7-10 days post operatively. After that, you can begin to get the incision wet in the shower (water and soap lightly run over the incision and pat dry). No immersion in a bath or until given approval by our office. MEDICATIONS \u2022 Local anesthetics are injected into the wound at the time of surgery. This will wear off within 8-12 hours. Patients commonly encounter more pain on the first or second day after surgery when swelling peaks. \u2022 Most patients will require some narcotic pain medication for a short period of time \u2013 this can be taken as directed on the bottle. \u2022 Common side effects of the pain medication are nausea, drowsiness, and constipation. To decrease the side effects, take the medication with food. We recommend a stool softener such as Colace (docusate) available over the counter and be sure to drink plenty of water. \u2022 If you are having problems with nausea and vomiting, contact the office to possibly have your medications changed. \u2022 Do not drive a car or operate machinery while taking the narcotic medication \u2022 Please avoid alcohol use while taking narcotic pain medication \u2022 If you are having pain that is not being controlled by the pain medication prescribed, you may take an over-the-counter anti-inflammatory medication such as ibuprofen (600 \u2013 800mg) or naproxen in between doses of pain medication. This will help to decrease pain Jason R. Ferrel, MD | 614-545-7958| @JasonFerrel_MD and decrease the amount of narcotic medication required. Please take as directed on the bottle. \u2022 For 4 weeks following surgery take one aspirin tablet daily to lower the risk of developing a blood clot after surgery. Please contact the office should severe calf pain occur, or significant swelling of the calf or ankle occur. ACTIVITY \u2022 You will be non-weight bearing in the boot after your surgery until released to progress weight bearing. \u2022 Elevate the operative leg \"toes above nose\u201d whenever possible to decrease swelling. You may remove the boot and wedges for elevating the extremity, careful not to move the ankle \u2022 Do not place pillows under knees (i.e. do not maintain knee in a flexed or bent position), but rather place pillows under the foot/ankle. Do not move the ankle or perform any range of motion of the ankle. \u2022 Do not engage in activities which increase pain/swelling (prolonged periods of standing or walking) for the first 7-10 days following surgery. \u2022 Avoid long periods of sitting (without leg elevated) or long distance traveling for 2 weeks. If you are ambulating the boot with wedges must be worn. \u2022 No driving until instructed otherwise by physician \u2022 May return to sedentary work or school 3-4 days after surgery, if pain is tolerable ICE THERAPY \u2022 Icing is very important in the initial post-operative period and should begin immediately after surgery. \u2022 Use icing machine continuously or ice packs (if machine not prescribed) for 20-30 minutes every 2 hours daily until your first post-operative visit \u2013 remember to keep leg elevated to level of chest while icing. Avoid frostbite to the skin by not using icepacks for more than 30 minutes at a time. \u2022 You do not need to wake up in the middle of the night to change over the ice machine or icepacks unless you are uncomfortable EXERCISE \u2022 It is ok to remove the boot and gently move your ankle, foot and toes as tolerated. You may perform range of motion of the knee and hip 3-4 times daily. \u2022 Discomfort and stiffness is normal for a few days following surgery. It is safe to bend your knee in a non-weight-bearing position when performing exercises unless otherwise instructed. \u2022 Formal physical therapy (PT) typically begins a few weeks after surgery. A prescription and protocol will be provided at your first postoperative visit unless deferred by Dr. Jason R. Ferrel, MD | 614-545-7958| @JasonFerrel_MD Ferrel.

To ensure the best possible pain relief after shoulder an explanation of this term) for pain following surgery is surgery, your doctors may use a pain control approach local anesthetic injection. Your surgeon may use this called multimodal analgesia. Multimodal analgesia means procedure during your shoulder surgery. The surgeon that you will receive two or more medications that provide injects a local anesthetic (similar to novocaine given at the pain relief and, when used together, more effectively block dentist) alone or in combination with other medications into pain signals. These medications can be given by the same the part of the body where the surgery is taking place. or different routes (such as intravenous [through a tube inserted into a vein], injections, or pills).

Injection of local anesthetics into the part of the surgery in order to help you recover more quickly and body where the surgery is taking place is a simple and easily. effective practice for controlling pain from surgical procedures. Local anesthetic injection can help reduce the One of the main goals of multimodal analgesia is to pain you experience after surgery, including pain that may decrease your need for opioid medications. Opioid occur when you walk or move around. Research studies medications include drugs derived from the opium plant have shown that injection of local anesthetics during (such as morphine) and also man-made drugs designed to surgery, when used as part of multimodal analgesia; have similar pain-reducing effects (oxycodone and provide effective relief of pain after surgery. They may also hydrocodone). Opioid medications provide effective pain reduce your need for opioid medications and help you to relief, but taking them regularly can lead to physical walk sooner after your surgery. dependence and, sometimes, addiction. They also may have serious side effects, such as a dangerous decrease in Of the medications used for local anesthetic injection, the ability to breathe. Using less opioid medication can help ropivacaine and bupivacaine are among the most common. decrease dangerous side effects and also other side A concern with these medications is that they are short effects (such as sleepiness, nausea, vomiting, and acting, so their pain-relieving effects may not last long constipation) that may be unpleasant for you and may enough after surgery. One alternative is a long-acting form interfere with your ability to participate in physical therapy. of bupivacaine that slowly releases medication at the injection site and may provide pain relief for a longer period Multimodal analgesia includes medications that you receive of time. Your surgeon will decide the best combination of before, during, and after surgery. Some of these medications for local anesthetic injection during your medications may be familiar to you; for example, surgery, if this technique is used. acetaminophen (Tylenol) and nonsteroidal anti- inflammatory drugs (Celebrex, Toradol, and others) are commonly given before and after surgery. Opioid medications are also used, especially when other medications do not give you enough pain relief. Another option for reducing pain after shoulder surgery is local anesthetic injection during surgery (see below for more information).

      "text_content": "J oint Arthroscopy P atient Information Author ID: RH Leaflet Number: Musc 023 Version: 6 Name of Leaflet: Joint Arthroscopy Last reviewed: January 2020 Next Review Date: January 2022 What is joint arthroscopy? Arthroscopy is a surgical procedure used to examine or treat problems inside a joint. It can be used to remove damaged and loose material that may be affecting joint movement. Arthroscopy can also be used to clean out a joint that is affected by a condition such as arthritis. Arthroscopy or keyhole surgery is performed using an arthroscope, this is a small telescope approximately 1cm in diameter, it contains a light source and a tiny camera, this is inserted through a small incision (cut) in the skin near the affected joint. Other instruments can be inserted into the joint through further small incisions. The arthroscopy procedure has developed and now can be used to examine and treat conditions in joints including hip, knee, shoulder and wrist. Benefits of arthroscopy The keyhole procedure used for arthroscopy is associated with a lower risk of complications than traditional surgery. Smaller incisions mean less pain in the post operative pain, surgery is faster, length of stay in hospital and the recovery period is shorter thus a return to normal activities is quicker. There is also a reduced risk of infection. Alternative treatment Occasionally physiotherapy can help with joint symptoms. The operation Before the operation you will be given an appointment to attend a pre-operative assessment clinic at the hospital. This is to assess your general health and fitness for surgery. Blood test, infection screening and x-rays; if necessary will be performed at this appointment. If you take any form of medication it is important that the staff in the clinic are aware. It is advisable to bring your medication with you or an up to date prescription sheet. Arthroscopy is most often performed on a day case basis, so you will be able to go home the same day as your operation. In some cases a patient who has Joint Arthroscopy additional medical problems may be admitted as an in patient and stay longer in hospital. The procedure can be performed under a local anaesthetic or a general anaesthetic. The doctor will discuss the anaesthetic options available to you before the operation. A general anaesthetic will require you to fast from food and drink for a minimum of six hours before the operation. During the operation the affected joint will be filled with sterile fluid to make viewing inside the joint easier. In some cases large volumes of fluid are used to wash out the joint. When the procedure is complete the fluid is drained from the joint, the small incisions made in the skin are closed with stitches if required or paper tapes. The area will be covered with a sterile dressing and a bandage applied. After the operation Following the procedure you may experience some discomfort around the affected joint which may continue into the day following surgery. To help with the discomfort you will be given pain relieving medication while you are on the ward. You will be given pain relieving medication and instructions to take home. It should be noted that as fluid is used to flush the joint during the arthroscopy, most is drained out of the joint immediately following the procedure in the operating theatre. However it is normal to expect seepage of blood stained fluid, which can be excessive especially in shoulder arthroscopies. Your dressing and bandage will be checked whilst you are on the ward by the staff and changed if necessary before you go home. In most cases a dressing pack and information will be given to you regarding changing the dressing yourself when you go home. If necessary a district nurse appointment can be made to check and change the dressing. If stitches have been used they will be removed by the district nurse/practice nurse approximately: 14 days following the procedure. Although a bandage is applied to the joint you may bend and straighten the limb as comfort allows. Information regarding exercise for the relevant joint will be given. Before discharge the ward staff will provide you with discharge information and a contact telephone number to use if any advice is required. Joint Arthroscopy You should make arrangements for your transport home from hospital as it is inadvisable to drive following the procedure. If you have a general anaesthetic you are advised not to drive for 24 hours following the anaesthetic, also to have a responsible person with you to look after you for this period of time. Risks involved with arthroscopy Joint arthroscopy is generally a safe procedure. However, with all surgical procedures there are risks, some of which are small and others are serious and may be life threatening. Risks for this procedure include: \uf0b7 Accidental damage to the joint or surrounding structures \uf0b7 Infection in the joint or skin incision \uf0b7 Bleeding \uf0b7 Loss of feeling to the skin around the joint \uf0b7 Un",

      "text_content": "Ankle or Subtalar Joint Arthroscopy: a guide to your recovery by Sam Singh This leaflet aims to answer your questions about having an ankle arthroscopy under the care of Mr Sam Singh. It explains the benefits, risks and alternatives, as well as what you can expect when you come to hospital. For more information please go to Mr Singh\u2019s Website: http://www.footandanklesurgeon.co.uk What is an ankle arthroscopy? Arthroscopy is an operation on a joint which is done by a \u2018keyhole\u2019 technique. An instrument containing a video camera is inserted into the ankle to look inside and small instruments are used to treat the problem. This allows the surgeon to help understand what is wrong with the ankle and treat the problem. What happens during an ankle arthroscopy? Ankle arthroscopy can be done as a day surgery procedure unless you have other significant medical problems that mean you may need to stay in hospital overnight. You will usually have a general anaesthetic (be asleep). The ankle is examined whilst you are asleep and the muscles are relaxed. Traction is applied to the ankle by gently pulling it and fluid injected. Small cuts are made to allow the camera and any instruments to be inserted into the ankle. The inside of the ankle is viewed through the camera and any necessary treatment carried out. The ankle is then cleaned out and the cuts stitched. The ankle is then bandaged. Why should I have an ankle arthroscopy? Ankle arthroscopy is often performed when an injury to the ankle fails to settle. It may help make a diagnosis, but you will often have a scan first. Problems such as arthritis and inflammation can be helped with arthroscopy, and it can be used to remove scar tissue build up, bone spurs and treat certain cartilage defects. What are the risks? In general, the risks of any operation relate to the anaesthesia and the surgical procedure itself. In most cases you will have a general anaesthetic. You will be able to discuss this with the anaesthetist before surgery and he/she will identify the best method for your individual case. The main surgical risks are listed below: Numbness: The commonest problem is numbness over the top of the foot or outer toes. This is because the cuts are close to the nerves to these areas. The nerves are pushed aside and may get stretched during surgery. Numbness normally recovers within two months, but a small number of patients have a small patch of permanent numbness. Infection: The cuts usually heal within two weeks, but may leak a small amount of fluid. In a very small number of cases (less than 3 in 100 patients), the wounds may become infected and need antibiotics. Joint damage: Occasionally some damage is done to the surfaces of the ankle joint during arthroscopy. Patients rarely have any symptoms from this. Ongoing pain and stiffness: 85 out of 100 patients will find their level of pain has improved. However, 15 out of 100 patients find that some of their pain continues and may get worse over time. The ankle may remain stiff. An ankle that has had a serious injury or surgery is unlikely to ever be as flexible as the normal ankle. Deep vein thrombosis: A clot in the leg, which can travel to the lungs, is a very rare but serious risk of ankle surgery. Measures are taken to reduce the chance of this happening. Arterial damage: A small artery runs in front of the ankle which can be damaged during surgery. This is rare and unlikely to have long term consequences but may require further surgery. Are there any alternatives? Managing the pain with other measures such as painkillers or living with the pain are alternatives. Sometimes a steroid injection can help. Physiotherapy may help managing the pain. How can I prepare for an ankle arthroscopy? You should make arrangements to be collected from the hospital. Someone should stay with you overnight if you have a general anaesthetic and your operation is a day case. You will need some time off work after the surgery. This will be at least 1-3 weeks but may be longer if you have a manual job. Mr Singh will discuss this with you. We advise you speak to your employer before surgery to make plans. The Day of the Surgery Mr Singh will see you before your operation. The anaesthetist will also see you before your operation, either on the ward or in theatre. Any queries about the anaesthesia are best discussed with him/her directly on the day. 1. Waiting for your operation: Please note that you may not be the first patient on the operating list and therefore have a variable amount of time during which you will be waiting to go to theatre; how long will depend in your place on the list. If you are the last patient to be scheduled for surgery, it may be up to three or four hours; you should therefore come prepared for a wait. Some reading material is provided by the day case unit but we appreciate a wait of several hours can be tedious; as such you may wish to bring a book, some work or other material to keep yourself occupied. 2.

Figure 1 Carpal tunnel syndrome is a condition caused by compression of the median nerve at the level of the wrist joint. Here the median nerve passes into the carpal tunnel along with flexor tendons and the tendon lining called tenosynovium. Carpal tunnel syndrome occurs when pressure builds up in the tunnel, and this can be due to swelling of the tenosynovium, fractures, arthritis, fluid retention during pregnancy and certain conditions such as diabetes and thyroid disease. Symptoms When the pressure on the median nerve becomes severe, you may notice wrist pain, tingling and numbness and clumsiness in hand movements. The tingling usually affects the thumb index and middle fingers and is worse at night or gripping activities eg driving a car. When carpal tunnel syndrome is severe, and longstanding, permanent nerve damage may occur, causing permanent numbness in the fingers, and the thumb (thenar) muscles may waste away. Diagnosis Carpal tunnel syndrome is usually diagnosed from your symptoms, and examination of your hand. X rays or scans may be required as there may be other pathology such as arthritis or ganglions or old trauma contributing to wrist symptoms. Sometimes electrical studies (nerve conduction velocity and electromyogram) are performed. These studies are uncomfortable but may need to be done, as your symptoms may be due to nerve compression elsewhere in your arm or in your neck. P age | 5 Treatment Non operative treatment is often successful in less severe cases. A splint may rest the wrist and allow the swelling in the carpal tunnel to settle. Anti-inflammatory tablets also help, or injections of corticosteroid directly into the carpal tunnel. Altering the workplace may help if you do a lot of repetitive work with your hands. In more severe cases, surgery is required. Pressure on the median nerve is released by surgically cutting the transverse carpal ligament. This can be done via a direct skin crease incision over the front of the palm (Fig 2); or by the endoscopic method where a telescope is passed via two mini incisions under the ligament (Fig 3), and the ligament is released from it\u2019s under surface. Figure 2 Figure 3 Following surgery the night time tingling in your hand usually settles quite quickly. If your fingers had established numbness and severe EMG changes prior to surgery then after surgery, the numbness may take months to resolve and recovery may be incomplete. Reduction in grip strength and soreness over the palm where the ligament has been divided (\u201cpillar pain\u201d) may last for weeks or even some months especially if you do heavy work. The endoscopic method may have an advantage over the direct incision method in that the recovery of function is quicker. However it has the disadvantage that complications may occur. These are very uncommon and include infection, bruising of the nerve, or damage to the blood vessels or tendons in the palm. After surgery, keep your hand elevated and do gentle finger exercises. Keep the bandage clean and at two week, stitches are removed. Heavy activities are avoided for 4-6 weeks. P age | 6 Cubital Tunnel Release What is it? Cubital Tunnel Syndrome occurs when the ulnar nerve is compressed at the back of the elbow (\u201cfunny bone\u201d). This causes tingling and numbness in the small and ring fingers, pain along the inner forearm, and sometimes weakness in using the hand. Symptoms are usually worse when the elbow is held in a flexed position eg holding a phone, sleeping at night etc. The nerve may be tingly when touched; and can be unstable, slipping forward and backwards when the elbow is flex",

What is Coronary Artery Disease? Coronary artery disease (CAD) is a condition that affects the blood flow to your heart. The coronary arteries that supply blood to the muscles in your heart are narrowed or blocked. This is usually caused by a build-up of cholesterol known as plaque. If this is not treated, CAD can lead to shortness of breath or chest pain, known as angina. You may have CAD because of high blood pressure, high cholesterol, diabetes, smoking, too much alcohol intake, or other risk factors. One of the tests your cardiologist may do to assess your arteries is called an angiogram. What is an Angiogram? An angiogram is a minimally invasive procedure where a small tube (catheter) is put into the artery in your wrist or groin. The cardiologist uses X-rays and X-ray dye to look at the blood vessels (arteries) that supply blood to your heart. The cardiologist may also measure the pressure inside the heart to see how well your heart pumps blood. You will be awake during the angiogram but will get a mild sedative and painkiller before the procedure starts and during the procedure as needed. When your blood vessels are blocked or damaged, the angiogram helps your cardiologist determine the source of the problem, the amount of the damage, and the best treatment options for you. My Angiogram \u00b7 5 In Hospital Diagnosing the Problem Diagnosing the Problem Understanding Your Treatment Options Depending on the results of your angiogram and other diagnostic tests, you may need more treatment. This may include angioplasty, coronary artery bypass surgery, or medication management. Angioplasty Angioplasty (or Percutaneous Coronary Intervention) is a minimally invasive procedure that opens up the arteries in your heart to improve blood flow. A cardiologist inserts a small tube (catheter) into the artery in your groin or wrist, like when you had an angiogram. In some cases, a balloon is inflated into the narrowed part of the artery to push the plaque against the vessel wall and make it wider. A small wire mesh (called a stent) may be put into your arteries to contain the plaque and help keep them open. The angioplasty may be done at the same time as your angiogram or scheduled at a later date. After an angioplasty, you will be prescribed two anti-platelet medications that you must take as prescribed. These medications will help keep the artery open after your blockage is repaired. Never stop taking these medications unless instructed by your cardiologist. Plaque blockage My Angiogram \u00b7 7 Diagnosing the P",

The Heart as a Pump The heart is a hollow organ made of strong muscles that pump blood in the body. The heart has four chambers: two chambers on the left and two on the right. The upper chambers are called an atrium, and collects blood from the body. The lower chambers are called a ventricle, and pumps blood out of the heart to the rest of your body. The four chambers work together to pump blood. The Heart\u2019s Electrical System The heart has an electrical system that produces tiny electrical impulses. The impulses travel from the upper to the lower chambers to tell it to contract and pump blood. The heart\u2019s electrical impulses normally begin at the sinoatrial node also known as the SA node. These special cells, known as the heart\u2019s natural pacemaker, are located at the top of the right atrium. It sends out electrical pulses at regular intervals and sets the rhythm for the heartbeat. From the atrium, the electrical pulses reach the atrioventricular node, AV node, which is located between the atrium and ventricles. The pulse than travels to the ventricles through conduction pathways to tell it to contract and pump blood. (see image on page 6) At rest, the heart beats between 60 to 100 beats per minute. My Atrial Fibrillation Catheter Ablation Guide \u00b7 5 My Angiogram Sinoatrial Node (SA) Right atrium Left atrium Left bundle branches Atrioventricular Node (AV) Left ventricle Bundle of His Right ventricle Right bundle branches What is Atrial Fibrillation? Sometimes, the heart\u2019s electrical system doesn\u2019t work properly. This can cause abnormal cells from the heart\u2019s upper chambers to cause Atrial Fibrillation (AFib), which is a condition that affects your heart's rhythm. With AFib, your heart may beat too fast, switch between fast and slow, or skip beats, causing an \u201cirregular\u201d heartbeat. Some people may not develop any symptoms, but AFib can make you feel dizzy, short of breath, weak, or feel like your heart racing. If it is not treated, AFib can get worse over time. Medications can help slow down fast or irregular heartbeats. This may not work for everyone and may cause side effects. If this happens, your doctor may suggest a procedure called catheter ablation. What is Catheter Ablation? Cardiac catheter ablation is a procedure used to treat abnormal heart rhythms like atrial fibrillation (AFib). A doctor inserts a thin, flexib",

Tobetter plan proper care, describing and understanding patients\u2019perception of recovery after heart valve replacement is essential. The objective was to describe theexperience of recovery athome after heart valve replacement. Methods: Qualitative interviews were conductedwith 10 patients representing the population and thesewere later transcribed. The analysis was inspired by Ricoeur\u2019stheory of interpretation,which consists ofthree levels: naive reading, structured analysis,and critical interpretation and discussion. Results: The overall concept that emerged was suffering weakness and struggling to resume normality. Patients all struggled to resume normal living, both in regaining physicalstrength and inreestablishing balance inoverall living. The overall concept can be interpreted interms of the following themes: Disturbed network:Invaluable relatives, Contact withhealthcarestaff,Rehabilitation.Disturbedbody:Stressful complications, Bodily attention,Physically affected,Physical capability.Recovery:Interrupted living,Suffering weakness, Gradualrecovery, Achieving normality. Reflections:Thoughts aboutthe procedure and Feeling sad andfragile. Conclusion: The study presents the main themes of network, body, recovery and reflection for tenpatients after heart valve replacement. These main themes can overall be summarized as suffering weakness and struggling to resume normality.Patients feltweak with a changed body, but after a long recovery process regained vitality and returned to theirdaily life.

Pacific St., Seattle, WA 98195 | 206.598.4300 Coronary artery disease (also called coronary atherosclerosis or ischemic heart disease) refers to changes in the coronary arteries. These arteries bring oxygen to the heart muscle. This disease develops slowly, causing the inner artery layer to thicken, become uneven, and trap cholesterol and calcium. Coronary Artery Bypass Surgery Coronary artery disease may require coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery. This operation helps blood flow to the heart again. The surgeon attaches a bypass graft (healthy blood vessel) to the aorta and to the coronary artery, bypassing the blocked or narrowed section. This improved blood flow to the heart muscle allows the heart to function more efficiently. It can also reduce or stop angina (chest pain), prevent heart attacks, and it may help you live longer. As many as 6 grafts (healthy blood vessels) are sometimes needed to fix all the narrowed or blocked arteries. We take bypass grafts from your leg veins (venectomy), the radial artery in your arms, or your internal mammary artery (IMA) in your chest wall. Choosing the right blood vessels for your surgery depends on your medical history. \u2022 The leg vein we use is the saphenous vein. This vein is just under the skin, and it goes from your inner ankle to your upper thigh. It can be removed without harming the circulation in your leg. \u2022 The IMA is about the size of a coronary artery, and it is located under your chest wall. This artery can be detached and sewn into the coronary artery. \u2022 The radial artery is in your lower arm. This artery can be detached and sewn into the coronary artery. What are the risks? Bypass surgery is complex, but it has a high rate of success. Between 95% and 99% of people survive the surgery. Complications are possible, including: \u2022 Pneumonia \u2022 Kidney damage \u2022 Collapsed lung (air leak between your lung and chest wall) \u2022 Angina (chest pain) \u2022 Stroke \u2022 Infection \u2022 Excessive bleeding \u2022 Heart attack \u2022 Heart palpitations (feeling of fast or abnormal heart rhythm) Your surgery team will talk with you about your specific risks based on your heart condition, past surgeries, and other diseases you have. Other possible problems include the risks of anesthesia, arrhythmia (irregular heartbeat), and wound infection. Because the valves are close _____________________________________________________________________________________________ | Your Guide to Cardiac Surgery Heart Institute | Box 356087 1959 N.E. Pacific St., Seattle, WA 98195 | 206.598.4300 to the areas that control heart function, there is a risk of a change in your heart rhythm. In this case, you may need a pacemaker or treatment with medication after the surgery. Heart Valve Replacement Surgery You may need valve replacement when one or more of your valves is diseased or no longer works. Prosthetic Valves A prosthetic valve is an artificial device that replaces a damaged or diseased heart valve. There are 3 main types of prosthetic valves. These are mechanical valves, bioprosthetic valves, and homografts. All prosthetic valves have possible long-term risks. There is also a risk of any prosthetic valve becoming infected. If you have valve replacement, you must take antibiotics before seeing the dentist, and possibly before other medical procedures. Talk with your cardiologist about care instructions related to your valve replacement before you see other healthcare providers. \u2022 Mechanical valves are made of strong, durable materials such as metal. They are very durable, and they help keep your blood flow normal. But the body sees mechanical valves as foreign or unfamiliar objects. Because of this, your body will try to coat the valve with thrombin (the part of blood used in clotting). This is dangerous because pieces of th",

Purpose/Background This document is based upon the 2013 consensus guidelines from American Society of Health-System Pharmacists (ASHP), the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA), the Surgical Infection Society (SIS) and the Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America (SHEA) (1). The Stanford Antimicrobial Safety and Sustainability Program, in conjunction with the anesthesiology and surgical departments, adapted its content to SHC as part of the 2024 SSI Taskforce. 1. Choice of antibiotics: Please see table I for acceptable choices of antibiotics based upon surgical procedure. Consider the addition of vancomycin or clindamycin for patients known to be colonized with MRSA. 2. Dose and re-dosing of antibiotics: Please see Table II for dosing and re-dosing guidelines. We recommend weight-based dosing of both cefazolin and vancomycin. Cefazolin should be administered every 4 hours; clindamycin every 8 hours; vancomycin does not require re-dosing given its long half-life. We recommend clinicians consider re-dosing earlier than specified in Table II if there is excessive intra- operative blood loss (e.g. >1500 mL). Aminoglycosides and vancomycin should not be re-dosed in this setting. 3. Timing of the pre-operative antibiotic dose: Guidelines recommend that pre-operative antibiotics be administered <60 minutes prior to incision to reach acceptable tissue concentrations. Exceptions: vancomycin and fluoroquinolones require a prolonged infusion time to avoid intolerance, especially at higher doses, thus 2 hours are allowed for administration (it\u2019s long half-life makes this acceptable.) 4. Duration of post-operative antibiotics: Based on updated recommendations from CDC guidelines and SHEA/IDSA/APIC, patients undergoing clean and clean-contaminated procedures do NOT need to receive any doses after incision closure even if a drain is present.4-12,15 Refer to solid organ transplant protocols if applicable.

      "text_content": "Chapter 18: Post-procedure management: complications; anticoagulation, standard pathways, discharge instructions and follow-up Gregory Pattakos MD, MS1, Joseph Coselli MD, FACC2 1Texas Heart Institute 2Baylor College of Medicine Anticoagulation Anti-platelet therapy consisting of lifelong aspirin at a dose of 75-100 mg and six months of clopidogrel at a dose of 75 mg is recommended after TAVR based on the 2017 AHA/ACC Valve Guidelines (Class IIb, LOE C)1. These recommendations were unchanged from the 2014 AHA/ACC Valve Guidelines. Updated for 2017, ACC guidelines now recommend anticoagulation with a VKA (vitamin K antagonist) to achieve an INR of 2.5 for at least 3 months after TAVR for patients at low risk of bleeding due to growing concerns over valve leaflet thrombosis (Class IIb, LOE B). However, no formal guidelines are provided regarding the optimal anticoagulation strategy for patients who are already on full anticoagulation for atrial fibrillation or another indication. In many institutions, however, patients who are already on a VKA will be continued on aspirin plus a VKA after TAVR, but the management of patients who are already on pre-existing novel oral anticoagulants is an area of ongoing investigation. Fortunately, multiple randomized trials are currently underway to study optimal anticoagulation after TAVR and will likely provide further clarity on the subject over the next several years that will influence future valve guidelines and recommendations. The ARTE trial evaluated aspirin monotherapy versus aspirin plus clopidogrel for patients undergoing TAVR2. The duration of clopidogrel was 3 months and a loading dose of 300mg was used followed by 75mg. Clopidogrel was started within 24 hours preoperatively for cases that were intended as transfemoral and within 24 hours postoperatively for transapical cases. The trial showed an increased risk of major bleeding events with dual antiplatelet therapy (10.8% vs. 3.6% in the single antiplatelet therapy group, p = 0.038) with no difference in rates of death, myocardial infarction, or stroke/TIA. However, a possible limitation of this trial is that the endpoints were measured at three months which may be too short a timeframe to see an effect of reduced anticoagulation on issues such as leaflet thrombosis. The POPular-TAVI trial is investigating whether the addition of clopidogrel to either aspirin or VKA is beneficial3. The trial will have two cohorts: Cohort A will randomize patients to either aspirin or aspirin plus clopidogrel and Cohort B will randomize patients to VKA or VKA plus clopidogrel. The final data collection date for the primary outcome measure will occur in August 2018. There is also increasing interest in the use of oral direct thrombin inhibitors after TAVR. One study investigating patients with atrial fibrillation after TAVR showed a lower risk of stroke with apixaban at 3 months although results at one year were similar4. The GALILEO study is an ongoing trial to assess use of rivaroxaban and aspirin versus clopidogrel and aspirin5. Patients in the experimental arm will receive rivaroxaban plus aspirin for 90days followed by rivaroxaban alone. In the control arm, patients receive clopidogrel plus ASA for 90days followed by ASA alone. In case new-onset atrial fibrillation occurs after randomization, full oral anticoagulation will be implemented with maintenance of the original treatment assignment. The AVATAR study (Anticoagulation Alone Versus Anticoagulation and Aspirin Following Transcatheter Aortic Valve Interventions) will examine patients already on VKA prior to TAVR and randomize them to either receive VKA alone or VKA plus aspirin after TAVR6. The ADAPT-TAVR (Anticoagulant Versus Dual Antiplatelet Therapy for Preventing Leaflet Thrombosis and Cerebral Embolization After Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement) trial will examine the effects of Edoxaban versus DAPT on the occurrence of leaflet thrombosis and cerebral emboli using MRI7. The ATLANTIS trial (Anti-Thrombotic Strategy After Trans-Aortic Valve Implantation for Aortic Stenosis) will compare Apixaban to VKA in patients who have an indication for VKA and it will also compare Apixaban to DAPT for patients who do not have an indication for VKA8. There have been some retrospective studies analyzing optimal anticoagulation management after TAVR. One meta-analysis of four studies comparing aspirin monotherapy to dual antiplatelet therapy found no benefit to dual therapy with an increased trend towards bleeding complications9. In another study, authors found that if patients are already receiving a VKA for other indications then this anticoagulation regimen should be sufficient without the addition of antiplatelet agents10. To further complicate the issue of anticoagulation after TAVR, there have recently been reports of subclinical thrombosis of biological valve leaflets11-13. This subclinical thrombosis has been reported in both SAVR and TAVR valves and the clinical meani",
