## Development Guidelines

### Code Style

We use:
- **Black** for code formatting
- **isort** for import sorting
- **Flake8** for linting
- **MyPy** for type checking

Run formatting and checks:
```bash
black postop_collector tests
isort postop_collector tests
flake8 postop_collector tests
mypy postop_collector
```

### Testing

Write tests for any new functionality:
```bash
# Run all tests
pytest

# Run with coverage
pytest --cov=postop_collector

# Run specific test file
pytest tests/test_specific.py

# Run tests in parallel
pytest -n auto
```

### Documentation

- Update README.md if needed
- Add docstrings to all functions/classes
- Update API_DOCUMENTATION.md for API changes
- Include inline comments for complex logic

### Commit Messages

We follow conventional commits:
- `feat:` New feature
- `fix:` Bug fix
- `docs:` Documentation changes
- `style:` Code style changes (formatting, etc.)

```

### Branch Naming

- `feature/` for new features
- `fix/` for bug fixes
- `docs/` for documentation
- `refactor/` for code refactoring
- `test/` for test improvements
